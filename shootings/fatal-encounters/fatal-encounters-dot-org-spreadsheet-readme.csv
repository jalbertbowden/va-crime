"We believe we include all the available records for all 50 states and DC back to 2000, but there are several data points that we think are too poorly reported in the news media to result in accurate results for analysis: disposition and mental state. Our racial data is the best that exists, but it's pretty spotty and gets worse prior to 2013. We'll be working on backfill for the next few months. We generally do weekly updates on Tuesdays (although for practical reasons, sometimes that's extended later into the week), so be aware we're usually a few days behind. Government data also suggests that police chase deaths are often not reported in news media, so our data almost certainly understates those totals. "

"Some words of caution. The vast majority of these records come from media sources and police records. That means only one version of the story—the police story—is generally told in the descriptions. Rarely do news media seek out family members and friends to balance or contradict police narratives. While we verify our data against media reports, sometimes the information presented is so wildly inaccurate that we instead include accurate but conflicting information."
"This project owes a great debt to the many volunteers and paid researchers who got us this far. Carla DeCeros' volunteer work was amazing. She did the initial work on more than 20 percent of this data. Walt Lockley also did incredible work, completing research on several key states. Christopher Cox did the bulk of the work on Texas. I can't begin to mention all the people who contributed, but those three moved the data collection ahead by years. We've also had two funders who came forward when we desperately needed help.  Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: The Institute for Interactive Journalism enabled us to move from a primarily crowdsourced, volunteer project to a more professional effort with a $12,000 grant. Our largest individual funder has been Jeff Moe, and his contributions have meant the difference between moving forward and shuttering the project."
