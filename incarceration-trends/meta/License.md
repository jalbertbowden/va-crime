Vera has developed and owns the Dataset, a collection of jail population and prison statistics that contains 45 years (1970-2015) of data for each of the approximately 3,000 counties that use a county jail (see the Dataset Github page for complete detail on the source datasets at https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration_trends). The Dataset was compiled by Vera staff using publicly available BJS data sourced through ICPSR. Vera is willing to grant Recipient access to the Dataset on the following terms:

The Recipient may not use the Dataset for any commercial or profit-making purpose. Recipient may only use the Dataset in accordance with this Agreement. Vera retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Dataset, and does not grant any rights in the Dataset other than as specified herein. 

## 2. Non-dissemination and Assurances
Recipient acknowledges that the Dataset is the proprietary information of Vera. The Recipient agrees to protect the Dataset from unauthorized access or use. The Recipient agrees not to use or distribute the Dataset in any form, electronic or otherwise, except as expressly permitted hereunder. The Recipient agrees that as a condition of accessing the Dataset, the Recipient agrees to the ICPSR Terms of Use for datasets available on (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/), as those terms apply to data sourced from ICPSR and included in the Dataset.

## 3. Indemnity
Recipient shall defend, indemnify, release, and hold Vera harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses arising out of their use of or access to the Dataset, including, without limitation, those arising from Recipient’s negligence or breach of any of the terms of this Agreement. This provision will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 

## 4. Miscellaneous
The Dataset is provided “as is.” Vera disclaims any and all warranties of any kind with respect to the Dataset, and the Recipient hereby releases Vera and waives any and all claims it may have against Vera in connection with Recipient’s use of the Dataset. Neither party may assign its rights under this Agreement without the express written permission of the other party. This Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. New York law will govern this Agreement and the New York courts will have jurisdiction over disputes arising hereunder.
