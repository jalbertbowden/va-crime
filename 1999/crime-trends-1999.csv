"Although we do not advocate adding two reporting systems in order to obtain a statewide total crime count for Virginia, we are providing the above crime counts in the two systems. These are the eight crimes contained in both systems; however, the summary system counts only the highest crime in an incident and the IBR system counts all offenses in an incident to a maximum of ten. For the offenses against a person in the IBR system, victim counts are recorded here instead of offense counts to be comparable to the data in the summary system.",,,
