      <p>The Charlottesville, Albemarle County, and University of Virginia Police Departments are requesting the continued assistance of the public in the identification of the black male individual who is responsible for at least seven (7) sexual assaults within the metropolitan area of Charlottesville, Va. Genetic testing has linked this series of sexual assaults with the most recent attack taking place on 08/18/2004 in Albemarle County.</p>
      <p>The joint task force that has been vigorously investigating these cases would like to once again stress the importance of the public's safety awareness. All residential doors, windows, etc., should remain locked at all times and the public should remain alert and focused on their surroundings, both at home and away.</p>
      <p>The Task Force offers the following observations regarding this offender:</p>
      <p><strong>Black male between the ages of 20 and 40 years of age.</strong></p>
