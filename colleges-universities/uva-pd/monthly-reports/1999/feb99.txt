* Particularly if walking or running alone, don't wear radio or recorder    
   earphones.
* Do not walk or run after dark.
* Do not walk or run near bushes which can provide concealment.
* Wear bright colored clothing to improve your visibility.
* Vary your route and pattern of walking or running.
* Carry a whistle or high decibel battery-powered personal  alarm device when
   you walk or run.
* If followed, go to the nearest residence, open business or group of people.
* Carry your motor vehicle and/or home key with you.
* Dial 911! Call the Police if you see anything suspicious.
