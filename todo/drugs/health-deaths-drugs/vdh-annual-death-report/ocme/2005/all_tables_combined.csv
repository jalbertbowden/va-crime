Letter from the Chief Medical Examiner
The staff of the OCME offers this report as a source of information on the state of Virginia’s
"health as reflected by the investigation of the sudden, unexpected and violent deaths occurring"
in calendar 2004. The OCME offers this report for agents of change with the hope that the
individual classes of death may inspire more intense study directed to prevention.
The identification of the classes of sudden unexpected natural death offers an opportunity for
health care providers to focus their attention on the diseases that strike our citizens in their
prime years. The number of deaths of infants has remained relatively constant the last several
years since the reduction in deaths associated with the “Back to Sleep” campaign indicating a
"continuing need to study the etiology of this heartbreaking phenomenon. Accidents, for the"
most part are preventable. Many could be avoided by utilizing current safety measures at
"home, in school, on the highway and in the workplace. Continuous education in health and"
safety targeted at our younger citizens might greatly reduce the years of life lost. Suicide is a
measure of despair. The individual stories underlying accomplished suicides at all ages are
profoundly sad. Many show profound social and emotional isolation suggesting a variety of
strategies need to be directed to reach out to Virginia’s emotionally wounded citizens.
"Homicides in Virginia are unsettling to all citizens, disturbing the public peace in addition to"
terminating lives and shattering families and friends. Efforts directed at altering high risk life
styles and intervening in the high risk cases of intimate and family violence need to be
"continued by health, mental health, criminal justice, legislative and other professionals who"
often labor under discouraging circumstances. Workers in these areas need our encouragement
and thanks.
The good news is that the annual report also shows when interventions are successful as the
number of fatalities in certain classes drops.
The report is the cooperative effort of many – from the local medical examiners and medical
"investigators who collected the initial circumstantial and medical information, law enforcement"
"investigators who tracked down the fine details and circumstances surrounding the death event,"
