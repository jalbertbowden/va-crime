Letter from the Chief Medical Examiner
"The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) presents to Governor Kaine, the Virginia"
"General Assembly, the justice system, Courts and the citizens a report of its activities for 2005."
"The OCME investigates deaths occurring in Virginia of persons who die a sudden and unexpected,"
"unattended, violent or suspicious death. The OCME’s major missions are to identify and certify"
"the cause of death, determine the manner of death, collect medical evidence and reconstruct how"
"injury occurred. In accomplishing these missions, the medical examiner wears two hats: the hat of"
the medical detective in assisting the criminal and civil justice system with the investigation of
violent deaths associated with violence and criminality and a public health hat wherein the medical
examiner documents injuries and deaths that might be preventable and to conduct surveillance for
deaths that may represent a disease process that is hazardous to the public health. The latter
includes emerging infections and bioterrorism agents. The OCME is also responsible for
"management of mass fatalities due to injuries related to weather, accident, suicide or terrorism"
"events. To assist with its prevention efforts, the OCME houses two death review teams, Child"
"Fatality Review and Maternal Mortality Review and two injury surveillance teams, the Family and"
Intimate Partner Violence Program and the National Violent Death Reporting System. All teams
produce reports available on the OCME website: http://www.vdh.state.va.us/medexam/.
This report is especially promulgated to those to have the power to effect change. This report
"represents many years of productive life lost by Virginians. The accidental deaths, in particular,"
beg for prevention strategies. The deaths due to suicide seek interventions and support for those
whose abject despair has led to their taking of their own lives. The homicides seek analysis for
circumstances that may be altered in such a way as to prevent them. The intimate partner violent
deaths have remained at about one third of homicides for years and are a particular tragedy in that
they occur between persons who at one time cared for one another.
The deaths of children deserve special attention because they are our societal future. The data
presented show there is prevention work to be done.
"Special thanks go to Anna Noller, PhD, OCME Forensic Epidemiologist for gathering and"
interpreting the mountain of OCME data.
The staff of the OCME serves Virginia’s citizens living and dead. It is hoped that its effort
inspires others to promote a healthy and long life.
