EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,
"The Virginia State Child Fatality Review Team, hereafter called the Team, was established by the General",
"Assembly in 1995. The purpose of the Team, outlined in §32.1-283.1, is to systematically analyze deaths",
among Virginia’s children who are less than 18 years old. Reviewed deaths may include violent and,
"unnatural deaths, sudden child deaths in the first eighteen months of life, and deaths where the cause",
and manner was not determined with reasonable medical certainty. Prevention and intervention recom-,
mendations are a crucial component of each Team review. Governed by the principles and practices of,
"public health, the Team conducts death reviews to learn about the causes and circumstances of individ-",
"ual deaths in order to develop suggestions for prevention, education and training that may reduce child",
deaths in the future.,
This report presents conclusions and recommendations from Virginia’s State Child Fatality Review Team,
after its review of Virginia’s 1998 unintentional injury deaths of children who were four years of age or,
younger at the time of their death. It also provides a description of all child deaths in Virginia for the,
same year. The findings of the report are summarized below.,
"The report was prepared for use by all Virginians – the Governor, members of the General",
"Assembly, child advocates, policy makers, parents and citizens – with the firm conviction",
that injuries and deaths to children can be reduced.,
Part One: Unintentional Injury Review.,
The Team examined records in 49 unintentional injury deaths to young children age four and under,
that occurred in Virginia in 1998. Their review yielded the following conclusions:,
"• The majority of unintentional injury death is preventable and, as such, represents a",
significant public health challenge for the Commonwealth. The Team concluded that 86%,
of these deaths were definitely or probably preventable.,
• More than one-third of the unintentional injury deaths to children were among infants. Three,
"common fatal agents among infants included suffocation, drowning and motor vehicle accidents.",
• The majority of injuries occurred at the child’s home.,
• Boys died more frequently than girls.,
• Black children were over represented among these deaths to young children. While black,
"children comprise 22% of all Virginia children less than five years of age, they were the victims",
of 43% of unintentional injury deaths in 1998.,
• Many families who lost a child in an unintentional injury death lived at or below the,
poverty level.,
• Review of these deaths underscored the importance of adult supervision to the prevention,
of future injury and death to young children.,
The Team’s review of specific forms of unintentional injury death suggested these conclusions:,
• Fatal injury from a motor vehicle accident was the major cause of unintentional injury,
death to Virginia’s young children in 1998. More than half of the children who died were,
not in a safety seat or seat belt at the time of the accident.,
