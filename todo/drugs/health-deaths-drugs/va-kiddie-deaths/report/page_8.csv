,"• The majority of suffocation deaths were to infants and, in every case, the child’s death was"
,related to sleeping arrangements. The Team concluded that effective interventions to prevent
,further injury and death must include public education messages about safe sleeping practices
,for infants and campaigns to provide safe cribs for families who cannot afford them.
,"• Drownings occurred in a variety of places, including swimming pools, bathtubs, and public"
,bodies of water. Team members noted that the crucial intervention message to caretakers is the
,need for vigilance when supervising infants and children around water.
,"• All fires took place in a family residence, four in a mobile home. The status of smoke detectors"
,in the home was not known in most cases. Team members reviewed cases where children died
,"when they became trapped in the sleeping areas of older mobile homes, revealing a need for"
,doors and escapable windows that could be retrofitted in these homes.
,"• In firearm fatalities, children died in their homes as a result of easy access to a loaded firearm."
,The Team made recommendations emphasizing five areas of change: legislative proposals; improvements
,in the investigation of children’s deaths; support for law enforcement and prosecution; public awareness
,campaigns; and support for early intervention programs.
,Part Two: Characteristics of All Children’s Deaths.
,"In 1998, 1,095 of Virginia’s children under 18 years of age died."
,"• A total of 817, or 74%, of child deaths were due to natural causes. Most of these deaths,"
,"655 or 80%, occurred in the first year of life."
,• Males of all race or ethnic backgrounds are more likely than their female counterparts to die
,from natural causes.
,• Leading causes of natural deaths to infants included conditions originating in the perinatal
,"period, congenital anomalies, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and circulatory system diseases."
,• Motor vehicle accidents were the leading cause of unintentional injury death among children
,ages one to seventeen.
,"• Over half of all homicides committed against children, 51%, were to children under the age of"
,five. Thirty-one percent (31%) of child homicides were committed against teenagers between
,the ages of 15 and 17. Firearms were used in 41% of all homicides.
,• Death rates for homicide reveal profound disparities. Rates for black male children far exceed
,"those for black females, all whites and all hispanics."
,"• Suicides occurred among children over the age of 10, particularly among 15 to 17 year olds."
,"More than half of all suicides, 54%, involved firearms."
,"• White males have the highest death rate for suicide, followed by black males. No suicides"
,occurred among hispanic males or black or hispanic females in 1998.
,"• Unintentional injury death rates are highest among hispanic and black males, and lowest"
,among hispanic females.
