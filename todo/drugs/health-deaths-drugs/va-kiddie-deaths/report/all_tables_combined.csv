iv,Virginia State Child Fatality Review Team • December 2001,
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY,
"The Virginia State Child Fatality Review Team, hereafter called the Team, was established by the General",
"Assembly in 1995. The purpose of the Team, outlined in §32.1-283.1, is to systematically analyze deaths",
among Virginia’s children who are less than 18 years old. Reviewed deaths may include violent and,
"unnatural deaths, sudden child deaths in the first eighteen months of life, and deaths where the cause",
and manner was not determined with reasonable medical certainty. Prevention and intervention recom-,
mendations are a crucial component of each Team review. Governed by the principles and practices of,
"public health, the Team conducts death reviews to learn about the causes and circumstances of individ-",
"ual deaths in order to develop suggestions for prevention, education and training that may reduce child",
deaths in the future.,
This report presents conclusions and recommendations from Virginia’s State Child Fatality Review Team,
after its review of Virginia’s 1998 unintentional injury deaths of children who were four years of age or,
younger at the time of their death. It also provides a description of all child deaths in Virginia for the,
same year. The findings of the report are summarized below.,
"The report was prepared for use by all Virginians – the Governor, members of the General",
"Assembly, child advocates, policy makers, parents and citizens – with the firm conviction",
that injuries and deaths to children can be reduced.,
Part One: Unintentional Injury Review.,
The Team examined records in 49 unintentional injury deaths to young children age four and under,
that occurred in Virginia in 1998. Their review yielded the following conclusions:,
"• The majority of unintentional injury death is preventable and, as such, represents a",
significant public health challenge for the Commonwealth. The Team concluded that 86%,
of these deaths were definitely or probably preventable.,
• More than one-third of the unintentional injury deaths to children were among infants. Three,
"common fatal agents among infants included suffocation, drowning and motor vehicle accidents.",
• The majority of injuries occurred at the child’s home.,
• Boys died more frequently than girls.,
• Black children were over represented among these deaths to young children. While black,
"children comprise 22% of all Virginia children less than five years of age, they were the victims",
of 43% of unintentional injury deaths in 1998.,
• Many families who lost a child in an unintentional injury death lived at or below the,
poverty level.,
• Review of these deaths underscored the importance of adult supervision to the prevention,
of future injury and death to young children.,
The Team’s review of specific forms of unintentional injury death suggested these conclusions:,
• Fatal injury from a motor vehicle accident was the major cause of unintentional injury,
death to Virginia’s young children in 1998. More than half of the children who died were,
not in a safety seat or seat belt at the time of the accident.,

,"• The majority of suffocation deaths were to infants and, in every case, the child’s death was"
,related to sleeping arrangements. The Team concluded that effective interventions to prevent
,further injury and death must include public education messages about safe sleeping practices
,for infants and campaigns to provide safe cribs for families who cannot afford them.
,"• Drownings occurred in a variety of places, including swimming pools, bathtubs, and public"
,bodies of water. Team members noted that the crucial intervention message to caretakers is the
,need for vigilance when supervising infants and children around water.
,"• All fires took place in a family residence, four in a mobile home. The status of smoke detectors"
,in the home was not known in most cases. Team members reviewed cases where children died
,"when they became trapped in the sleeping areas of older mobile homes, revealing a need for"
,doors and escapable windows that could be retrofitted in these homes.
,"• In firearm fatalities, children died in their homes as a result of easy access to a loaded firearm."
,The Team made recommendations emphasizing five areas of change: legislative proposals; improvements
,in the investigation of children’s deaths; support for law enforcement and prosecution; public awareness
,campaigns; and support for early intervention programs.
,Part Two: Characteristics of All Children’s Deaths.
,"In 1998, 1,095 of Virginia’s children under 18 years of age died."
,"• A total of 817, or 74%, of child deaths were due to natural causes. Most of these deaths,"
,"655 or 80%, occurred in the first year of life."
,• Males of all race or ethnic backgrounds are more likely than their female counterparts to die
,from natural causes.
,• Leading causes of natural deaths to infants included conditions originating in the perinatal
,"period, congenital anomalies, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and circulatory system diseases."
,• Motor vehicle accidents were the leading cause of unintentional injury death among children
,ages one to seventeen.
,"• Over half of all homicides committed against children, 51%, were to children under the age of"
,five. Thirty-one percent (31%) of child homicides were committed against teenagers between
,the ages of 15 and 17. Firearms were used in 41% of all homicides.
,• Death rates for homicide reveal profound disparities. Rates for black male children far exceed
,"those for black females, all whites and all hispanics."
,"• Suicides occurred among children over the age of 10, particularly among 15 to 17 year olds."
,"More than half of all suicides, 54%, involved firearms."

,may be established for the purpose of conducting contemporaneous reviews of local child deaths in order to develop inter-
,ventions and strategies for prevention specific to the locality or region. Each team shall establish rules and procedures to gov-
,ern the review process. Agencies may share information but shall be bound by confidentiality and execute a sworn statement
,to honor the confidentiality of the information they share. Violations shall be punishable as a Class 3 misdemeanor. The State
,Child Fatality Review Team shall provide technical assistance and direction as provided for in subsection A of § 32.1-283.1.
,B. Local and regional teams may be composed of the following persons from the localities represented on a particular board or

,"tor of the relevant local or district health department, a chief law-enforcement officer, a local fire marshal, the attorney for the"
,"Commonwealth, an executive director of the local community services board or other local mental health agency, and such"
,"additional persons, not to exceed five, as may be appointed to serve by the chairperson of the local or regional team. The"
,chairperson shall be elected from among the designated membership. The additional members appointed by the chairperson
,"may include, but are not restricted to, representatives of local human services agencies; local public education agencies; local"

,as a Class 3 misdemeanor.
,"E. Members of teams, as well as their agents and employees, shall be immune from civil liability for any act or omission made in"
,"connection with participation in a child fatality review team review, unless such act or omission was the result of gross negli-"
,"gence or willful misconduct. Any organization, institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports or records"
,"to review teams as part of such review, shall be immune from civil liability for any act or omission in furnishing such informa-"
,"tion, unless such act or omission was the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct. (1999, c. 867.)"
