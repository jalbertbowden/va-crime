Introduction & Executive Summary 		
		2013 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 	
 	In 2013, the Coast Guard counted 4,062 accidents that involved 560 deaths, 2,620 	
	injuries and approximately $39 million dollars of damage to property as a result of 	
	recreational boating accidents. 		
	 	The fatality rate was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 registered recreational vessels. 	
		This rate represents a 13% decrease from last year’s fatality rate of 5.4 	
		deaths per 100,000 registered recreational vessels. 	
	 	Compared to 2012, the number of accidents decreased 10%, the number of 	
		deaths decreased 14%, and the number of injuries decreased 12.7%. 	
 	Where cause of death was known, seventy-seven (77) percent of fatal boating 	
	accident victims drowned. 	Of those drowning victims with reported life jacket usage, 	
	eighty-four (84) percent were not wearing a life jacket. 	
 	Where instruction was known, twenty (20) percent of deaths occurred on boats where 	
	the operator had received boating safety instruction. 	Only thirteen (13) percent of 	
	deaths occurred on vessels where the operator had received boating safety 	
	instruction from a NASBLA-approved course provider. 	
 	Eight out of every ten boaters who drowned were using vessels less than 21 feet in 	
	length. 		
 	Operator inattention, improper lookout, operator inexperience, excessive speed, and 	
	machinery failure rank as the top five primary contributing factors in accidents. 	
 	Alcohol use is the leading known contributing factor in fatal boating accidents; where 	
	the primary cause was known, it was listed as the leading factor in 16% of deaths. 	
 	Twenty-two children under age thirteen lost their lives while boating in 2013. 	Eight
	children or approximately thirty-six (36) percent of the children who died in 2013 died 	
	from drowning. 	Two children or twenty-five (25) percent of those who drowned were 	
	wearing a life jacket as required by state and federal law. 	
 	Where data was known, the most common types of vessels involved in reported 	
	accidents were open motorboats (46%), personal watercraft (18%), and cabin motor- 	
	boats (17%). 		
 	The 12,013,496 recreational vessels registered by the states in 2013 represent a 	
	0.7% decrease from last year when 12,101,936 recreational vessels were registered.

Introduction & Executive Summary 							
Mission and Strategic Plan of the National Recreational Boating Safety Program 		
The mission of the National Recreational Boating Safety (RBS) Program is “to ensure the public has a
safe, secure, and enjoyable recreational boating experience by implementing programs that minimize
the loss of life, personal injury, and property damage while cooperating with environmental and national
security efforts”. 											
The 	Strategic 	Plan 	of 	the 	National 	Recreational 	Boating 	Safety 	Program 	delineates 	the 	Program’s
eleven objectives to reduce casualties which include 1) tracking and increasing the number of educated
boaters; 2) delivering effective boating safety messages to target audiences; 3) increasing the number of
on-the-water boating instruction recipients; 4) studying and increasing life jacket wear rates; 5) increas-
ing boater knowledge of and compliance with navigation rules; 6) decreasing boating under the influ-
ence; 7) decreasing the number of defective vessels; 8) increasing boater compliance with vessel car-
riage requirements; 9) increasing the accuracy and reporting rates of reportable accidents; 10) conduct-
ing research and development of boating safety initiatives; and 11) measuring the effectiveness of non-
profit organization grants. 									
To that end, the data in this report is used in many Strategic Plan measurements. 	Contributing factor
data is used to measure navigation rules compliance outlined in Objective 5. 	Alcohol use as a contribut-
ing factor is used to measure boating under the influence in Objective 6. 	Data collection as a whole is
focused upon in Objective 9, Accident Reporting. 	Further, data is used for research endeavors outlined
in Objective 10. To view the Strategic Plan of the Program, please visit the Office’s website at http://
www.uscgboating.org. 									
Overview of Statistics 									
This report contains statistics on registered recreational vessels and boating accidents during calendar 	
year 2013. Data used to compile the recreational boating accident statistics come from three sources: 	
	 	Boating Accident Report (BAR) data forwarded to the Coast Guard by states with an ap- 	
		proved casualty reporting system; and 						
	 	Reports of Coast Guard investigations of fatal boating accidents that occurred on waters 	
		under Federal jurisdiction. Recreational boating accident investigation data are used if sub-
		mitted to the Coast Guard and are relied on as much as possible to provide accurate acci- 	
		dent statistics. In the absence of investigation data, information is collected from the acci- 	
		dent reports filed by boat operators; and 					
	. 											
	 	Reports received from news media sources that the Coast Guard did not receive investiga-
		tive data on by the state. The following table reflects the number of accidents, deaths, inju- 	
		ries, and losses of vessels that were captured in news media sources that met reporting 	
		requirements for which the Coast Guard did not receive a report.

Changes to the Publication 								
Some of the tables in this edition of the Statistics have changed because of alterations to the content on
the Coast Guard’s Boating Accident Report (BAR) form. 	One of the most dramatic changes lies in the 	
cause categories. 	“Passenger/skier behavior” and “careless/reckless operation” were removed from the
latest BAR form because it was believed that the public would not report a negative behavior about 	
themselves. 	Since these categories were removed from the Coast Guard form, they will not be reported
in the national publication. 	For those jurisdictions that did not use the Coast Guard form to collect infor-
mation and still used passenger/skier behavior and careless/reckless operation as a cause, the Coast 	
Guard coded their cause according to the choices on the Coast Guard BAR form. 	An example of a case
where the Coast Guard was able to code one of these causes to one available on the Coast Guard form
is as follows: if a jurisdiction had selected “passenger/skier behavior” to describe an accident where an 	
Recreational Boating Statistics 2013 							8
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 10 of 80”
Table: 9
Introduction & Executive Summary 	
occupant stood up in a canoe which led to the capsizing of the vessel, the Coast Guard coded this 	
cause as “improper loading” instead of “passenger/skier behavior”. 	An example of a case where the
Coast Guard was not able to code one of these causes to a cause available on the Coast Guard form is
as follows: a passenger on a vessel became injured while jumping out of a vessel while it was in motion.
In this case, the Coast Guard coded the accident as “other” and captured “passenger/skier behavior” in
the “other accident cause” category. 	“Careless/reckless operation” was likewise coded such that when
applicable, it was coded as “Rules of the Road”. 	In other cases, the cause was coded as “other”.
Other changes include a graph that was added on page 18 to reflect the percent of accidents that are 	
fatal by time of day. 	A graph and table were added on page 48 to reflect the percent of deaths attributed
to each vessel type for years 2004-2013. 	A graph was added on page 51 to reflect the number of in-
jured victims under age 18 by age group and injury type on personal watercraft. 	A graph and table were
modified on page 57 to reflect the motorized fatality rate by year. 	A table was modified on page 67 to
provide fatality rates by state. 	The boating accident report form on pages (69-74) of this report was re-
vised in September 2011 to reflect the addition of a privacy statement and instructions, as well as a field
for the date of birth of the operator and injured victim. 	
Finally, four of the statistics in the Executive Summary were changed to remove the records where val-
ues were unknown. 	This new calculation method affects the fourth, fifth, eighth, and tenth bullet points.
To find information on the number of “unknown” cases excluded, please reference Tables 35 (on page 	
62), 22 (on page 45), 5 (on page 19), and 7 (on page 24) respectively. 	
Accident Reporting as Required by Federal Law 	
Under federal regulations (33 CFR Part 173; Subpart C – Casualty and Accident Reporting) the operator
of any numbered vessel that was not required to be inspected or a vessel that was operated for recrea-
tional purposes is required to file a BAR when, as a result of an occurrence that involves the vessel or its
equipment: 	
1. A person dies; or 	
2. A person disappears from the vessel under circumstances that indicate death or injury; or 	
3. A person is injured and requires medical treatment beyond first aid; or 	
4. Damage to vessels and other property totals $2,000 or more; or 	
5. There is a complete loss of any vessel. 	
If the above conditions are met, the federal regulations state that the operator or owner must report their
accident to a state reporting authority, abbreviated in this publication as “state”. The reporting authority 	
can be either the state where the accident occurred, the state in which the vessel was numbered, or, if 	
the vessel does not have a number, the state where the vessel was principally used. The owner must 	
submit the report if the operator is deceased or unable to make the report. 	
The regulations also state the acceptable length of time in which the accident report must be submitted
to the reporting authority. Boat operators or owners must submit: 	
1. Accident reports within 48 hours of an occurrence if: 	
a. A person dies within 24 hours of the occurrence; or 	
b. A person requires medical treatment beyond first aid; or 	
c. A person disappears from the vessel. 	
2. Accident reports within 10 days of an occurrence if there is damage to the vessel/property only. 	
The minimum reporting requirements are set by Federal regulation, but states are allowed to have more
stringent requirements. For example, some states have a lower threshold for reporting damage to ves- 	
sels and other property. 	
Federal Regulations (33 CFR 174.121) require accident report data to be forwarded to Coast Guard 	
Headquarters within 30 days of receipt by a state.

Introduction & Executive Summary 	
The statistics in this publication cover boating accidents reported on waters of joint federal and state ju-
risdiction and exclusive state jurisdiction. Most states use BAR forms that are similar to the Coast Guard
form. 	A copy of the Coast Guard BAR form used for this report is on pages 69-74.
Casualty and Accident Reporting Guidelines 	
Casualty and accident reporting applies to each “vessel” used by its operator for recreational purposes
or vessels that are required to be numbered and are not subject to inspection.
This publication reflects watercraft that have been deemed a “vessel.” 	Terms used to describe the vari-
ous types of watercraft are: airboat, auxiliary sailboat, cabin motorboat, canoe, houseboat, inflatable
boat, kayak, open motorboat, personal watercraft, pontoon, raft, rowboat, sailboat, and stand up paddle-
board. 	Reports received involving watercraft that have not been determined to be “vessels” to date,
such as single unmodified innertubes, have not been included in the statistics in the main body of this
report. 		
“Reportable” Boating Accidents 	
A vessel is considered to be involved in a “boating accident” whenever a death, missing person, per-
sonal injury, property damage, or total vessel loss results from the vessel's operation, construction, sea-
worthiness, equipment, or machinery. 	
The following are examples of accident types that are used in this report:
 	Grounding, capsizing, sinking, or flooding/swamping 	
 	Falls in or overboard a vessel 	
 	Persons ejected from a vessel 	
 	Fire or explosions that occur while underway and while anchored, moored or docked if the fire re-
	sulted from the vessel or vessel equipment. 	
 	Water-skiing or other mishap involving a towable device 	
 	Collision with another vessel or object 	
 	Striking a submerged object 	
 	A person struck by a vessel, propeller, propulsion unit, or steering machinery
 	Carbon monoxide exposure 	
 	Electrocution due to stray current related to a vessel 	
 	Casualties while swimming from a vessel that is not anchored, moored or docked.
 	Casualties where natural causes served as a contributing factor in the death of an individual but the
	determined cause of death was drowning. 	
 	Casualties from natural phenomena such as interaction with marine life (i.e. leaping sturgeon
	causes casualty to person) and interaction with nature (i.e. mountain side falls onto vessel causing
	casualties). 	
 	Casualties where a person falls off an anchored vessel. 	
 	Casualties that result when a person departs an anchored, disabled vessel to make repairs, such as
	unfouling an anchor or cleaning out the intake of a jet-propelled vessel.
“Non-Reportable” Boating Accidents 	
Not every occurrence involving a vessel is considered within the scope of the National Recreational
Boating Safety Program. The following occurrences involving a vessel may be required to be reported to
the state, but for statistical purposes are excluded from this report and are considered “non-reportable”
boating accidents: 	
 	A person dies, is injured, or is missing as a result of self-inflicted wounds, alcohol poisoning, gun-
	shot wounds, or the ingestion of drugs, controlled substances or poison.
 	A person dies, is injured, or is missing as a result of assault by another person or persons while
	aboard a vessel. 	
 	A person dies or is injured from natural causes while aboard a vessel where the vessel did not con-
	tribute to the casualty.

Introduction & Executive Summary 	
Use of Statistics 	
Following are some important points that users of these statistics need to be aware of: 	
1. An approved casualty reporting system does not include every accident involving a vessel that is be-
ing used for recreational purposes. Some accidents are not in the system because they are not required
to be reported. Many accidents are not reported because boaters are not aware of the accident reporting
regulations or fail to comply with such regulations. 	
In an attempt to make sure all fatal boating accidents are captured by the casualty reporting system and
required data are input into the Boating Accident Report Database (BARD) System, the Coast Guard 	
notifies and provides information from its Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE)
system to state Boating Law Administrators (BLAs) of fatal accidents that occurred in their state. The 	
Coast Guard also sends news media stories to state BLAs on fatal and non-fatal boating accidents that
occur in their state to capture accidents that may have been missed. 	
2. Federal regulations do not require the reporting of accidents on private waters where states have no
jurisdiction. Reports of accidents on such waters are included in this report when received by the Coast
Guard if they satisfy the other requirements for inclusion. 	
3. Non-fatal accidents cannot be assumed to have occurred in numbers proportional to the reported sta-
tistics because the act of reporting an accident is not a random sampling of accidents in the statistical
sense. Rather, selection is based on the ability and willingness of those involved to file a report. 	
4. The fluctuations in non-fatal accident statistics from year to year may be caused by factors other than
the change in the total number of recreational boating accidents. A small change in the low reporting 	
rate may cause a relatively large change in the statistics. 	
The statistics in this publication are based on accident data submitted by reporting states as of April 8,
2014 with subsequent updates as information is reviewed and standardized. 	This publication covers
only accidents meeting the aforementioned reporting requirements.

Accident Causes & Conditions 	
Explanation of Accident Causes and Conditions Section 	
The following eighteen tables and figures focus on the causes of accidents with a special focus on alco-
hol use, the operation and activity at the time of accident, weather and water conditions, vessel informa-
tion, and the time of accidents. 	
Percent of Accidents that are Fatal by Month (Figure 1 & Table 4, Page 17) 	
This table provides information about total accidents, fatal accidents, non-fatal accidents, and deaths.
The figure focuses on the percent of fatal accidents by month. 	
As a background note, fatal accidents are accidents that involve at least one death. 	For example, a fatal
accident could be a capsizing that resulted in three deaths. 	It was an accident that had at least one
death. 	
Percent of Accidents that are Fatal by Time Period (Figure 2, Page 18) 	
This table reflects the percentage of accidents that are fatal by time period. 	The two categories in
which accidents are more frequently fatal span the hours between midnight and 4:30am. 	
Primary Contributing Factor of Accidents & Casualties (Table 5, Page 19) 	
The "contributing factors" of an accident are the causes of the accident. 	In the Coast Guard's national
accident reporting database, there are allowances for up to four causes. This table reflects the first 	
cause listed for all accidents, deaths and injuries nationwide. 	
For the purposes of displaying information in a simplified manner, the Coast Guard divided the contribut-
ing factor categories into five larger categories: operation of vessel, loading of passengers or gear, fail-
ure of vessel or vessel equipment, environment, and miscellaneous. 	These five categories are situated
in the leftmost column of the table and have the total number of accidents, deaths, and injuries associ-
ated with each category under the category name. 	
Machinery & Equipment Primary Contributing Factor of Accidents & Casualties (Table 6, Page 	
20) 	
This table reflects the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries where machinery or equipment failure
was listed as a first cause of the accident. 	The table also delineates the different types of failure that
were listed. 	
Primary Contributing Factor of Accidents (Figure 3, Page 21) 	
This figure reflects the first cause of accidents for all accidents nationwide. 	
Primary Contributing Factor of Deaths (Figure 4, Page 22) 	
This figure reflects the first cause listed for all deaths. 	
Primary Contributing Factor of Injuries (Figure 5, Page 23) 	
This figure reflects the first cause listed for all injuries. 	
Number of Vessels in Accidents by Vessel Type & Primary Contributing Factor (Table 7, Page 24)
This table looks at the number of vessels involved in accidents by vessel type and the primary cause of
the accident. 	
Alcohol Use as a Contributing Factor in Accidents & Casualties by State 2009-2013 (Table 8, 	
Page 25) 	
This table reflects a tally of all four causes of accidents listed for all national accidents, deaths and inju-
ries. 	
This table lists accidents where alcohol use by the vessel’s occupants was listed as a direct or indirect
cause of the accident. 	There are other cases in the national database where alcohol use is listed as
being involved in the accident but it was not determined to be a cause of the accident.

Accident Causes & Conditions 	
Vessel Operation at the Time of Accident (Table 9, Page 26) 	
This table focuses on the vessel operation at the time of the accident. 	The table lists information about
the number of vessels involved, the resulting number of deaths and the resulting number of injuries.
Vessel Activity at the Time of Accident (Table 10, Page 26) 	
This table examines the vessel and victim activity at the time of the accident. 	The table provides infor-
mation about the number of vessels involved, the resulting number of deaths, and the resulting number
of injuries. 	
Weather & Water Conditions (Table 11, Page 27) 	
This table documents some of the environmental characteristics of accidents. 	It focuses on accidents,
deaths and injuries by type of body of water, water conditions, wind level, visibility, and water tempera-
ture. 	
Time Related Data (Table 12, Page 28) 	
These three sections independently examine time-related information for accidents, deaths, and injuries.
The top section documents the number of accidents, deaths and injuries that occurred during a time
frame. 	The middle section documents the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries that occurred dur-
ing a given month. 	Finally, the bottom section documents the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries
that occurred during a given day of the week. 	
Each section examines the national data separately and should not be combined to draw conclusions.
For instance, one cannot use them to deduce that the majority of accidents occur from 2:31 pm-4:30 pm
in July on the weekends. 	However, you could deduce that 2:31 pm-4:30 pm was the time frame that
accidents occurred during calendar year 2013. 	Furthermore, the month with the highest number of acci-
dents was July. 	Finally, the two days of the week with the greatest number of accidents were Saturday
and Sunday. 	
Vessel Information (Table 13, Page 29) 	
This table documents some of the characteristics of vessels involved in accidents. 	It provides informa-
tion about the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries by horsepower, year built, length, and hull mate-
rial. 	
Rental Status of Vessels Involved in Accidents (Table 14, Page 30) 	
This table examines whether a vessel involved in an accident was rented. 	It also provides information
on whether deaths and injuries occurred on rented vessels. 	
Number & Percent of Deaths by Vessel Length (Figure 6 & Table 15, Page 31)
This table focuses on the number of deaths by vessel length. 	Deaths are categorized into drownings
and non-drownings. 	The table also provides a percentage of all deaths that were caused by drowning.

Accident Types 				
	Explanation of Accident Types Section 			
The following section contains six tables that examine data related to the events, called accident types,
in accidents. 	The tables focus on these events and break down information by state, vessel type, vessel
length, engine type, and propulsion. 				
In the Coast Guard's national database, there are four fields that can be used to define the series of 	
events in an accident. 	By events, we mean the series of occurrences that passed during an accident. 	If
a wave broke over a vessel causing it to take on water, capsize, and eject its occupant, the Coast Guard
would categorize this accident by three events. 	First, there was a flooding/swamping. 	Then, there was
a capsizing. 	Third, there was an ejection. 			
With the exception of one table, the tables and figures in this report focus only on the first event in the 	
sequence. The rationale for providing only the first accident type is to keep the tables simplistic; if we 	
added the second, third, and fourth events in the boating sequence, our accident, casualty, and damage
totals would not match up because they would be double-counting the accidents, casualties, and dam-
ages for cases that had more than one event. 			
Accident, Vessel & Casualty Numbers by Primary Accident Type (Table 16, Page 35) 		
This table focuses on the first event in a boating accident and provides information on the number of 	
accidents, vessels, and casualties attributed to that first event. 	The deaths section is also separated by
the categories drownings and non-drownings. 			
Five-year Summary of Frequency of Events in Accidents & Casualties Nationwide (Table 17, 	
Pages 36-39) 				
As mentioned in the introductory paragraph, there are four fields that can be used to define the series of
events in an accident. 	This table focuses on the first three events in an accident and the number of 	
casualties associated with each event. 	The Coast Guard leaves out the fourth because it is not a stan-
dardized field. 				
Using the example in the opening paragraphs, the flooding/swamping would fall under the intersection of
the column "First Event in an Accident" and the row "Flooding/swamping”. 	The capsizing would be 	
marked under the column "Second Event in an Accident" and the row "Capsizing". 	Finally, the ejection
would be marked under the column "Third Event in an Accident" and the row "Ejected from Vessel”. 	
This table focuses on the frequency that these events occurred nationally and the total number of deaths
that were associated with each accident type. 	If we turn back to our example and focus on deaths as a
result of flooding/swamping, we see that there were 430 accidents where flooding/swamping was the 	
first event in the boating accident. 	There were 67 deaths associated with this first event type. 	However,
there were other accidents that involved a flooding/swamping as a second or third occurrence. 	There 	
were 228 accidents and 16 deaths associated with flooding/swamping as a second event and 54 acci- 	
dents and 11 deaths associated with flooding/swamping as a third event. 	All combined, you get the 	
sixth column of the table that looks at how many deaths were associated with an event that occurred 	
either as the first, second, or third occurrence in an accident. 	Please note that in this table deaths are 	
not separated by first, second and third event. 	In the example, there were 712 accidents and 94 deaths
associated with flooding/swamping as a first, second or third event. 			
This table can be difficult to understand, especially when the reader is under the expectation that the 	
tallies of the casualty columns will equal the numbers published at the front of this report that reference
the number of reportable accidents and deaths. 			
Number of Vessels in Accidents by Vessel Length & Primary Accident Type (Table 18, Page 40) 	
This table displays the types of accidents by the length of vessel. 	The table lists vessel length by foot 	
for vessels of lengths 4 ft-39 ft. 	After 39 ft, information is categorized in ranges. 	This table also provides
information about the number of casualties and vessels associated by length of vessel.

Accident Types 	
Number of Vessels in Accidents by Vessel Type & Primary Accident Type (Table 19, Page 41) 	
This table examines the first event of a boating accident for all vessels involved in an accident. 	It also
provides information about the casualties associated with each vessel type. 	
Number of Vessels in Accidents by Primary Accident Type & Propulsion Type (Table 20, Page 42)
This table provides information about the number of vessels involved in accidents by primary accident 	
type, propulsion, and engine type. 	
Number of Vessels in Accidents by Primary Accident Type & Engine Type (Table 21, Page 42) 	
This table provides information about the number of casualties and vessels associated by propulsion, 	
engine and primary accident type.

Table: 41
Operator/Passenger Information 		
	Explanation of Operator/Passenger Information Section 	
The following section contains eleven tables and figures that examine data relating to the operators and
passengers in accidents. 	Information is displayed by age, boating safety instruction, type of injury, and
cause of death. 		
Operator Information (Table 22, Page 45) 		
This table provides information about the operator. 	Information covers a variety of topics including age,
boating operation hours experience, number of people onboard the vessel, and the boating safety in-
struction level of the operator. 		
Examples of “other” boating safety instruction include licenses issued from the Coast Guard, military
training, police academy training, rental operator training, commercially-available courses, and camp
training. 	Informal training signifies that the operator did not receive instruction in a formal classroom
setting but rather learned from experience. 		
Number of Deaths by Type of Operator Boating Instruction (Table 23 & Figure 7, Page 46)
This table and accompanying figure focus on boating safety instruction for those operators who had a
person die on their vessel. 	The table and figure both focus on instruction provided by the U.S. Coast
Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadrons, American Red Cross, and State sources. 	The figure examines
only deaths where the operator instruction was known. 		
Number of Deaths by Vessel Type (Table 24 & Figure 8, Page 47) 		
This table documents deaths by vessel type with a focus on drownings. It also provides the percentage
of deaths by drowning by type of vessel. 		
Percentage of Deaths by Vessel Type, 2004-2013 (Figure 9 & Table 25, Page 48)
This table and accompanying figure focus on the percentage of deaths that occurred on each vessel
type for the past ten years. 	The figure may be interpreted by measuring the upper and lower bounds of
the color-coded vessel type to obtain the percentage of deaths attributed to that vessel type within the
year. 		
Please note that the percentages in the table have been rounded up. 		
Number of Deceased Victims by Age & Vessel Type (Table 26, Page 49) 	
This table documents the age of fatal accident victims by vessel type. 	It also delineates the number of
drownings, non-drownings, and total deaths by age. 		
Number of Injured Victims by Age & Vessel Type (Table 27, Page 50) 	
This table documents the age of injured victims by vessel type. 		
Nature of Primary Injury Type by Area of Injury 2013 (Table 28, Page 51) 	
This table focuses on the nature and area of the primary injury of injured victims. 	
Number of Injured Victims under Age 18 by Age Group and Injury Type on Personal Watercraft,
2013 (Figure 10, Page 51) 		
This table focuses on the number of injured victims from personal watercraft for specific age groups and
by type of injury.

Casualty Data 		
	Explanation of Casualty Data Section 	
This section contains eleven tables and figures that examine data relating to the victims in boating acci-
dents. 	The following pages focus on historical casualty information, casualty-vessel information, and 	
state-specific casualty information. 		
Deaths, Injuries & Accidents by Year, 1997-2013 (Figure 11 & Table 29, Page 54) 	
This figure and table document the number of accidents and casualties from 1997-2013. 	
Accident, Casualty & Damage Data by State (Table 30, Page 55) 	
This table provides accident, casualty, and damage information by state for the year 2013. 	Accidents
are broken down into three levels of severity– fatal accidents, non-fatal injury accidents, and property 	
damage only accidents. 	This table also provides the number of casualties and property damage by 	
state. 		
Distribution of Recreational Boating Deaths by State (Figure 12, Page 56) 	
This figure provides the percentage that each state contributed to the national death count. 	So, for in-
stance, Michigan had 21 deaths. 	Out of the total national death count of 560, Michigan contributed 3.8%
((21/560) * 100) of deaths to the national count. 	Please note that percentages have been rounded. 	
Annual Recreational Boating Fatality Rates, 1997-2013 (Figure 13 & Table 31, Page 57) 	
This table and accompanying figure provide two fatality rates for years 1997-2013. 	The fatality rate is
calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the total national vessel registration. 	The Coast Guard
then multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to arrive at the number of deaths per 100,000 registered vessels.
One fatality rate takes into account all fatalities and all recreational registration data collected. 	The sec-
ond fatality rate takes into account only fatalities that occurred on motorized vessels and only motorized
recreational vessels registered. 		
States Coded by their 2013 Fatality Rate (Figure 14, Page 58) 	
This figure displays states that are color-coded depending on their fatality rate which is expressed as the
number of deaths that occurred in that state per 100,000 vessels that that state registered. 	It is impor-
tant to note that not all states register the same types of vessels which could skew the fatality rates pro-
vided. 	Please see Table 38, Recreational Registration Data by State 2012-2013 to view the Scope of 	
each state’s registration system. 		
Five-year Summary of Selected Accident Data by State, 2009-2013 (Table 32, Page 59) 	
This table examines the number of accidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities by state for years 2009- 	
2013. 		
Number of Accidents by Primary Accident Type & State (Table 33, Page 60-61) 	
This table documents the first accident event by state. 	It also provides information about the total num-
ber of accidents and casualties by state. 		
Number of Injured Victims by Primary Injury & Vessel Type (Table 34, Page 62) 	
This table displays the number of injured victims by primary injury and vessel type. 	
Number of Fatal Victims by Life Jacket Wear, Cause of Death, & Vessel Type (Table 35, Page 62)
This table displays the number of fatal victims by vessel type and cause of death. 	The table also pro-
vides information on whether the deceased victim was wearing a life jacket.

*1997 was the first year statistics were compiled for accidents that occurred three or more miles offshore in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean and nine or more miles in the Gulf of Mexico. NJ
did not submit property damage estimates to boats. 	However, NJ noted that accidents submitted to the Coast Guard that did not have an injury or death were considered to have $2000 or more in
damages. 	The Coast Guard adjusted NJ's property damages to boats such that each accident without an injury or death had $2000 damages.

Registration Data 		
	Explanation of Registration Data Section 	
The following section contains fives tables and figures that examine boat registration information. 	Reg-
istered vessels are those vessels that are required to be recorded by a state, which includes numbered
vessels and other forms of registration. 	Not all states have the same registration requirements. 	While
some states may only register vessels with a motor, others may register sailboats, canoes, kayaks, and
rowboats in addition to those vessels with a motor. 	
Recreational Vessel Registration by Year, 1980-2013 (Table 36 & Figure 15, Page 65) 	
This table provides information about recreational vessel registration for each year from 1980-2013. 	
The accompanying figure displays a trend line from 1980-2013. 	
Recreational Vessel Registration by Length & Means of Propulsion (Table 37, Page 66) 	
The top section of the table provides tallies for the number of mechanically-propelled vessels, the num-
ber of manually-propelled vessels, and a summation of these two categories. 	The middle section of the
table documents mechanically-propelled vessel registration by length category and engine type. 	The
bottom section of the table focuses on manually-propelled vessels. 	
Registration Data by State (Table 38, Page 67) 	
This table examines recreational vessel registration, deaths, and fatality rates by state for years 2013 	
and 2012. 	The fatality rate is calculated by dividing the number of fatalities by the total vessel registra-
tion. 	The Coast Guard then multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to arrive at the number of deaths per 	
100,000 registered vessels. 	This table also specifies the scope of the state’s registration program. 	
Distribution of 2013 Recreational Vessel Registration by State (Figure 16, Page 68) 	
This figure provides the percentage that each state contributed to national registration figures. 	So, for
instance, California registered 820,490 vessels. 	Out of the total national registration of 12,013,496, Cali-
fornia contributed 6.8% ((820,490/12,013,496) * 100) of registered vessels. 	Please note that percent-
ages have been rounded.

Collision with Fixed Object - The striking of any fixed object, above or below the surface of the water.
Collision with Floating Object - Collision with any waterborne object above or below the 	
surface that is free to move with the tide, current, or wind, except another vessel. 	
Collision with Commercial/Governmental/Recreational Vessel - Any striking together of two or more
vessels, regardless of operation at the time of the accident, is a collision. 	
Collision with Submerged Object - A boat’s collision with any waterborne or fixed object that is below
the surface of the water. 	
Congested Waters - Where the body of water is either too small or narrow to safely accommodate the
number of boats on it. 	
Cruising - Proceeding normally, unrestricted, with an absence of drastic rudder or engine changes.

Drifting - Underway, but proceeding over the bottom without use of engines, oars or sails; being carried
along only by the tide, current, or wind. 	
Electrocution - Death or injury resulting from an electrical current that comes in contact with water 	
causing electrocution of the victim. 	
Excessive Speed - Speed above that which a reasonable and prudent person would have operated 	
under the conditions that existed. It is not necessarily a speed in excess of a posted limit. 	
Failure to Vent - Prior to starting the engine, failure to turn on the powered ventilation system that 	
brings in “fresh air” and expels gasoline vapors from the engine compartment.

substances such as wood. 	
Fire/Explosion (other) - Accidental burning or explosion of any material onboard except vessel fuels or
their vapors. 	
Flooding/Swamping - Filling with water, regardless of method of ingress, but retaining sufficient
buoyancy to remain on the surface. 	
Force of Wave/Wake - The track in the water of a moving boat; commonly used for the disturbance of
the water (waves) resulting from the passage of the boat’s hull.

explosive or combustible vapors or liquids on board. 	
Grounding - Running aground of a vessel, striking or pounding on rocks, reefs, or shoals; stranding.
Hazardous Waters - Rapid tidal flows (the vertical movement of water) and/or currents (the horizontal
flow of water) resulting in hazardous conditions in which to operate a boat.
Houseboat - A motorized vessel designed primarily with accommodation spaces with little or no fore-
deck or cockpit, with low freeboard and with a low length to beam ratio.
Hull Failure - Defect or failure of the structural body of a vessel (i.e., hull material, design, or construc-
tion) not including superstructure, masts, or rigging. 	
Ignition of Spilled Fuel or Vapor - Accidental combustion of vessel fuel, liquids, and/or their vapors.
Improper Anchoring - Where a boat is either in the process of being anchored incorrectly or incorrectly
held in place in the water by an anchor. 	
Improper Loading - Loading, including weight shifting, of the vessel causing instability,
limited maneuverability, or dangerously reduced freeboard. 	
Improper Lookout - No proper watch; the failure of the operator to perceive danger because no one
was serving as lookout, or the person so serving failed in that regard. Every vessel shall at all times
maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the pre-
vailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of col-
lision. 	
Inflatable - A vessel constructed with its sides and bow made of flexible tubes containing pressurized
gas. On smaller inflatables, the floor and hull beneath it is often flexible.
Kayak - A small boat with a cockpit that is propelled by a double-bladed paddle by a sitting paddler.
Inadequate On-board Navigation Lights - Insufficient and/or improper lights shown by a boat that indi-
cate course, position, and occupation, such as fishing or towing.
