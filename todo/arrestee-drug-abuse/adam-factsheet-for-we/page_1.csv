Some key highlights from the report:,Some key highlights from the report:
•,"In 2012, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) extended the Arrestee"
,Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM II) data collection on drug use and other related
,"behaviors among adult male booked arrestees that began in 2000, but limited the"
,"number of sentinel sites to five rather than the ten sites included since 2007. In addition,"
,"data collection occurred over one, 21-day period rather than the two, 14-day periods in"
,"the 2007-2011 period. The five ADAM II sites continuing in 2012 were Atlanta, GA;"
,"Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; New York, NY; and Sacramento, CA."
•,"In these five sites, 1,938 interviews were conducted and 1,736 urine samples collected for"
,"testing in one, 21-day collection period, then weighted to represent over 14,000 arrests."
•,ADAM II continued to highlight the considerable regional variation in drug use that can
,"be masked in national estimates. In Sacramento, 40 percent of adult male booked"
,"arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine at the time of arrest, compared to less"
,"than 1 percent in all other sites except Denver, where 13 percent tested positive. The"
,percentage of ADAM II arrestees testing positive for cocaine metabolites also varied
,"considerably, from 9 percent in Sacramento to 32 percent in Atlanta."
•,Arrestees represented in ADAM II are a population often not well represented in other
,"monitoring systems or surveys focusing on the Nation’s illegal drug use. In 2012, 16"
,percent of all ADAM II arrestees had changed residence three or more times in the prior
,"year and 10 percent were homeless in the 30 days prior to arrest, making them highly"
