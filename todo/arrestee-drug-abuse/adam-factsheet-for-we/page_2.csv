,"surveys. Similarly, although over 60 percent of ADAM II arrestees in all five sites had at"
,"least one drug in their system at the time of arrest, 70 percent had never been in any"
,form of drug or alcohol treatment.
•,ADAM II data highlight the need to validate answers to drug use questions in surveys.
,The agreement between self-report of drug use and a positive urine test matched to the
,appropriate window of detection varied considerably by drug: 83 percent of the ADAM
,"II arrestees with a positive marijuana test result admitted use, but only 63 percent of"
,"those testing positive for methamphetamine, 50 percent of heroin positives and 43"
,percent of cocaine metabolites positives admitted use.
•,Marijuana remained the drug most often detected in ADAM II arrestees in all five sites
,"in 2012, ranging from 37 percent of ADAM II arrestees testing positive in Atlanta to 58"
,"percent testing positive in Chicago. In three of the five sites, over half of the adult male"
,arrestees tested positive for marijuana.
•,"Cocaine (often ingested as crack), while the second most commonly detected drug in all"
,"but Sacramento, continued to show a significant decline in use everywhere. The"
,percentage of ADAM II arrestees testing positive for cocaine metabolites has declined
,"significantly from the early years of ADAM collection in all sites, dramatically in some"
,sites. Cocaine metabolite positives dropped from 50 percent of ADAM arrestees testing
,"positive in 2000 in Chicago to 19 percent in 2012, and from 52 percent in 2000 in New"
,York to 25 percent in 2012.
•,"There has been a statistically significant, increasing trend in the percentage of ADAM"
,"arrestees testing positive for opiates in all but New York and Chicago. In those two sites,"
,there has been a significant decline from previously high base rates of 20 percent (New
,York) and 36 percent (Chicago) of ADAM arrestees testing positive for opiates in 2000 to
,10 percent and 15 percent respectively. While there has been anecdotal evidence linking
,"prescription painkillers to heroin use, 2 percent or fewer arrestees tested positive for the"
,"synthetic opiates of the oxycodone family of drugs in 2012 in any site, suggesting that"
,the rise in prescription drug use may not extend to this population.
•,Methamphetamine remained a significant problem in Sacramento (40 percent testing
,"positive) and Denver (13 percent testing positive) in 2012. In both sites, the 2012"
,"percentages were significantly higher than found in 2000, when 31 percent of"
,Sacramento adult male arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine and only 3
,percent tested positive in Denver.
