Some key highlights from the report:,Some key highlights from the report:
•,"In 2012, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) extended the Arrestee"
,Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM II) data collection on drug use and other related
,"behaviors among adult male booked arrestees that began in 2000, but limited the"
,"number of sentinel sites to five rather than the ten sites included since 2007. In addition,"
,"data collection occurred over one, 21-day period rather than the two, 14-day periods in"
,"the 2007-2011 period. The five ADAM II sites continuing in 2012 were Atlanta, GA;"
,"Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; New York, NY; and Sacramento, CA."
•,"In these five sites, 1,938 interviews were conducted and 1,736 urine samples collected for"
,"testing in one, 21-day collection period, then weighted to represent over 14,000 arrests."
•,ADAM II continued to highlight the considerable regional variation in drug use that can
,"be masked in national estimates. In Sacramento, 40 percent of adult male booked"
,"arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine at the time of arrest, compared to less"
,"than 1 percent in all other sites except Denver, where 13 percent tested positive. The"
,percentage of ADAM II arrestees testing positive for cocaine metabolites also varied
,"considerably, from 9 percent in Sacramento to 32 percent in Atlanta."
•,Arrestees represented in ADAM II are a population often not well represented in other
,"monitoring systems or surveys focusing on the Nation’s illegal drug use. In 2012, 16"
,percent of all ADAM II arrestees had changed residence three or more times in the prior
,"year and 10 percent were homeless in the 30 days prior to arrest, making them highly"
,1
,transient and unlikely to be eligible for inclusion in general population household
,"surveys. Similarly, although over 60 percent of ADAM II arrestees in all five sites had at"
,"least one drug in their system at the time of arrest, 70 percent had never been in any"
,form of drug or alcohol treatment.
•,ADAM II data highlight the need to validate answers to drug use questions in surveys.
,The agreement between self-report of drug use and a positive urine test matched to the
,appropriate window of detection varied considerably by drug: 83 percent of the ADAM
,"II arrestees with a positive marijuana test result admitted use, but only 63 percent of"
,"those testing positive for methamphetamine, 50 percent of heroin positives and 43"
,percent of cocaine metabolites positives admitted use.
•,Marijuana remained the drug most often detected in ADAM II arrestees in all five sites
,"in 2012, ranging from 37 percent of ADAM II arrestees testing positive in Atlanta to 58"
,"percent testing positive in Chicago. In three of the five sites, over half of the adult male"
,arrestees tested positive for marijuana.
•,"Cocaine (often ingested as crack), while the second most commonly detected drug in all"
,"but Sacramento, continued to show a significant decline in use everywhere. The"
,percentage of ADAM II arrestees testing positive for cocaine metabolites has declined
,"significantly from the early years of ADAM collection in all sites, dramatically in some"
,sites. Cocaine metabolite positives dropped from 50 percent of ADAM arrestees testing
,"positive in 2000 in Chicago to 19 percent in 2012, and from 52 percent in 2000 in New"
,York to 25 percent in 2012.
•,"There has been a statistically significant, increasing trend in the percentage of ADAM"
,"arrestees testing positive for opiates in all but New York and Chicago. In those two sites,"
,there has been a significant decline from previously high base rates of 20 percent (New
,York) and 36 percent (Chicago) of ADAM arrestees testing positive for opiates in 2000 to
,10 percent and 15 percent respectively. While there has been anecdotal evidence linking
,"prescription painkillers to heroin use, 2 percent or fewer arrestees tested positive for the"
,"synthetic opiates of the oxycodone family of drugs in 2012 in any site, suggesting that"
,the rise in prescription drug use may not extend to this population.
•,Methamphetamine remained a significant problem in Sacramento (40 percent testing
,"positive) and Denver (13 percent testing positive) in 2012. In both sites, the 2012"
,"percentages were significantly higher than found in 2000, when 31 percent of"
,Sacramento adult male arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine and only 3
,percent tested positive in Denver.

•,An analysis of changes in the average age of users of each drug over time included all 10
,of the original ADAM II sites from 2000-2011 and added data from the five 2012 sites.
,These analyses showed that cocaine and methamphetamine users are an aging
,population in many of the 10 sites. Opiates presented a different picture with an
,"increasing proportion of younger users in some sites (Indianapolis, Minneapolis,"
,Portland) and a stable or aging group in others.
