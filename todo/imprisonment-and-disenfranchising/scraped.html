About the Series
A large number of US men of prime working age are neither gainfully employed nor pursuing education or other training,
suggesting a potentially significant disconnection from mainstream economic and social life. The Urban Institute, funded by
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, US Department of Health and Human Services, convened
the Race, Place, and Poverty symposium to better understand the experiences of men who were disengaged or at high risk of
disengagement from mainstream economic and social systems. The symposium explored the state of knowledge on discon-
nected low-income men and discussed effective strategies for improving their well-being.
The five briefs in this series on disconnected low-income men summarize the symposium, provide a geographic and
demographic snapshot of low-income men, and examine their education, employment, health, and heightened risk of
incarceration and disenfranchisement. A related background paper prepared for the symposium features key themes from
ethnographic and other qualitative research.
