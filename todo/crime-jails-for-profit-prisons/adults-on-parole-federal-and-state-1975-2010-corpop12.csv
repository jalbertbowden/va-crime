"Note:  The Annual Parole Survey collects population counts for January 1 and December 31 of the reporting year. Because some agencies update their yearend population counts during the following  reporting year, BJS has historically used this information to update the annual counts in this spreadsheet. While the 2010 data represents the population count on December 31, 2010, the 2009 data reflect the updated population counts reported for January 1, 2010. The 2008 data reported here represent the updated counts received for January 1, 2009, etc. This differs with how data were prepared for the most recent report, ""Probation and Parole in the United States, 2010"", in which the population for each year represents that reported for December 31 of that year, for the purpose of making comparisons within the same reporting year. Probation and Parole in the United States, 2010, is available on the BJS website at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/ppus10.pdf.
