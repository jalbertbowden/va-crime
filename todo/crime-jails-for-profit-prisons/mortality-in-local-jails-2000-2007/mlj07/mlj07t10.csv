"Note: Mortality rates are based on the average daily population (ADP). In 2000 and 2001, ADP was estimated by taking the average of January 1 and December 31 one-day inmate population counts. Inmate populations for age and offense are estimates based on the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails. Inmate populations for sex, race/Hispanic origin and legal status are estimates based on the 2000 through 2007 Annual Survey of Jails. Detail may not sum to total due to rounding. All causes of death are included in the calculations of the total mortality rate.",,,,,,,,,,,
