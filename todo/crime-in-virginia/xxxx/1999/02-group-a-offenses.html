<h1><a id="a-definitions" href="#nogo">Definitions of Categories of Group A Offenses</h1>
<p>For practical purposes of measuring the trend and distribution of crime on the National and State level, the definitions for crime in the Incident Based Reporting (IBR) Program are generic in order not to exclude varying state and Federal statutes relating to the same type of crime. The definitions which were developed for IBR are not meant to be used for charging persons with crimes. Essential to the maintaining of uniform and consistent data is the establishment of standard definitions which are used for the State and National Programs.</p>
