Robbery
The taking, or attempting to take, anything of value under
confrontational circumstances from the control, custody,
or care of another person by force or threat of force or
violence and/or by putting the victim in fear of immediate
harm
Because some type of assault is an element of the crime of
robbery, an assault is not reported as a separate crime as
long as it was performed in furtherance of the robbery.
