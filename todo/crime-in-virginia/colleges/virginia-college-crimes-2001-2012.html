The Clery Act requires colleges to report annually the count of certain crimes that happen on their campuses. To determine the number of crimes reported, as well as the rate of their occurrence, The Dispatch and the Student Press Law Center analyzed 12 years of crime statistics that colleges with on-campus housing reported to the U.S. Department of Education.
