Old Dominion University Annual Security and Fire Safety Report 	2013-2014
Dear Campus Community, 	
Thank you for taking time to review the annual security and fire safety report which contains
information on safety and security policies, procedures, safety programs and resources
available at Old Dominion University. Additionally, this report provides statistics for crimes that
are reported to the university police and security personnel as well as fire safety information
inclusive of fire statistics for all University-owned residence halls. This report is provided in
conformity with the Jeanne Clery Act of 1998 and the associated amendments including the
recently adopted Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. 	
Old Dominion University instituted several enhancements to campus safety over the last year
including the addition of 1,060 safety cameras, under the Cameras for Safety Program, in
locations such as public areas within parking garages, residence halls, academic buildings, and
other areas across the exterior of the campus. This supplements the mobile video/audio
recording system utilized in all marked police vehicles providing valuable information for ODU
officers in prosecuting traffic and criminal offenses as well as identifying training areas for
police. 	
The University also deployed a mobile app (ODU LiveSafe) that provides an easy, anonymous
way for the community to send tips via text, photos, and audio or video clips 	directly to the
ODU police communications center, free of charge. 	
Moreover, free home safety evaluations are provided to students residing off campus. Those
that need window/door locks and alarms can get them free of charge from the University.
I encourage you to review this report, and participate in the safety and educational programs
offered, and to utilize the safety resources provided by Old Dominion University. By working
together, remaining vigilant and reporting suspicious or criminal behavior immediately to the
University Police, our campus will be a safer place. 	
Sincerely, 	
Rhonda Harris 	
Director of Public Safety & 	
Chief of Police
