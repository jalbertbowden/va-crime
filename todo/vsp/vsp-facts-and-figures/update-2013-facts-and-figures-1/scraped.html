Superintendent’s Office 						
Four departments fall under the Superintendent’s Office: 			
	• 	Executive Protective Unit (EPU) 						
	• 	Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls (OPMIC) 		
	• 	Professional Standards Unit (PSU) 						
	• 	Public Relations Office (PRO) 							
Executive Protective Unit 							
The Executive Protective Unit’s (EPU) primary duty is to provide protection for the
Governor and his family and is comprised of sworn members of the agency. The
Unit provides 24-hour security and travels with the Governor and his family at all
times. 		EPU 	coordinates 	the 	Governor’s 	schedule, 	secures 	routes 	for 	upcoming
appearances 	and 	events, 	and 	works 	with 	local, 	federal 	and 	other 	state 	law
enforcement agencies when traveling to ensure the security and effectiveness of
the Governor’s detail. 									
Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls 	
Established in March 2007, the Office of Performance Management and Internal
Controls (OPMIC) was created to track and monitor progress on the objectives
established 	in 	the 	Virginia 	Performs 	performance 	management 	system 	and 	to
ensure 		compliance 	with 	standards 	developed 	by 	central 	government 	oversight
agencies. 	OPMIC is also tasked with managing the Agency Risk Management and
Internal 	Control 	Standards 	(ARMICS) 	initiative 	for 	the 	Department. 	OPMIC 	is
comprised of the Internal Audit Section and the Planning and Research Section. 	
Internal Audit Section 									
Internal Audit performs audits and reviews of Virginia State Police operations for
the purpose of monitoring the agency’s performance in maximizing the efficiency
and effectiveness of Department operations and strengthening internal controls.
Internal auditors follow professional auditing standards and carry out the scope of
their work in an independent and objective manner. Results of all internal audits are
reported 	to 		management 		and 	the 	Superintendent, 	along 	with 	relevant
recommendations for improvement. Some of the common types of internal audits
include: 													
• 	Review of the reliability of financial data and related financial reporting of
	operations 											
• 	Review of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures 		
• 	Audits of various operational areas or programs within the Department 	
• 	Reviews of the safeguarding of assets and the prevention/detection of losses,
	errors, or irregularities 									
• 	Audits of information technology systems and related security of data 		
											6 | Fac ts 	and 	Fi g ur es

Table: 7
• 	Review or testing of the Department’s compliance with the Agency Risk
	Management and Internal Controls Standards (ARMICS) 				
Planning and Research Section 								
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all
divisions and units of the Department and is responsible for: 					
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies 	
• 	Updating staffing formulas 									
• 	Coordinating 	the 	Department’s 	accreditation 	and 	grants 	management
	programs 											
• 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies 				
• 	Maintaining the State Police Manual 							
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s performance and productivity
	measures 											
• 	Providing support in the development of grant applications and budgetary
	submissions 											
• 	Conducting legislative studies mandated by the General Assembly 		
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan and Service Area
	Plans 												
• 	Developing and maintaining the Department’s Continuity of Operations Plan
• 	Preparing the annual Use of Force Report 						
• 	Conducting the annual Citizen Survey 							
During 	2013, 	the 	Planning 	and 		Research 	Section 	administered 	38 	grants 	that
provided approximately $13 million in funding for agency projects. 			
Accreditation 											
In July 2013, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by the
Commission 	on 	Accreditation 	for 	Law 	Enforcement 	Agencies 	(CALEA) 	receiving
“Accreditation with Excellence.” 		The Department was fully compliant with the
accreditation standards and received many favorable reviews from the public input
component of the evaluation. 										
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA, as
the Department, in 1986, became the second state law-enforcement agency in the
nation to receive official accreditation by CALEA. 						
Maintaining 	accredited 	status 	is 	an 	on-going 	project 	for 	all 	accredited 	law
enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law
enforcement standards. 	In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven
agencies 	awarded 	a 	Certificate 		of 	Meritorious 	Accreditation 	for 	successfully
maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 						
								7 | Fac ts 	and 	Fi g ur es
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 53”
Table: 8
The 	purpose 	of 	the 	accreditation 	process 	is 	to 	improve 	the 	delivery 	of 	law
enforcement 	services 	by 	demonstrating 	that 	an 	agency’s 	operations 	are 	in
compliance with nationally recognized best practices. 	Accreditation requires a
comprehensive 	review 	of 	every 	aspect 	of 	the 	Department’s 	organization,
operations, and administration. 									
Professional Standards Unit 								
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs and staff
inspection functions within the Department of State Police. 				
The 	Internal 	Affairs 	Section 	conducts 	and 	coordinates 	the 	investigations 	of
allegations of misconduct on the part of Department employees. During 2013, 424
internal 	investigations 	were 	processed. 	The 	unit 	also 	investigates 	complaint
referrals pertaining to Department employees from the State Employee Fraud,
Waste, and Abuse Hotline. 									
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components
within the Department, ensuring compliance with National Accreditation Standards,
OSHA requirements, and Department policies and procedures. 	Six staff inspections
were conducted in 2013. 	The Staff Inspection Section also manages all records
retention and destruction within the Department. 						
Public Relations Office 									
The Public Relations Office (PRO) is responsible for planning, developing, managing
and implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations information
and educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to maintaining
daily contact with the public and media, the PRO disseminates news releases and
maintains Department social media sites in regards to state police programs and
activities, traffic safety enforcement, and crime prevention. The office also develops
and 	implements 	highway 	safety 	and 	public 	awareness 	media 	campaigns 	and
conducts press interviews around the state. 							
The PRO staff consists of a Public Relations Director and two Public Relations
Coordinators 	at 	State 	Police 	Administrative 	Headquarters. 	The 	Public 	Relations
Office assists and supports the Department’s Public Information Officers (PIO)
assigned to four of the seven field divisions. PIO’s respond to the scenes of major
highway crashes, criminal incidents, and handle regional press inquiries in order to
assist the media in providing direct and timely information to the public.

level public safety and service agencies. 	The STARS Network is supported 24/7
by the STARS Network Operations Center (NOC). 							
The STARS project provides a private data network with statewide geographical
coverage allowing units to operate mobile computer terminals through the radio.
Mobile data use has now been expanded to the entire state with supplemental
wireless data throughout all divisions. 									
The Communications Division provides design, engineering, maintenance, and
technical support for the Commonwealth Link to Interoperable Communications
(COMLINC) 	project 	that 	consolidated 	the 	efforts 	of 	several 		regions 	of 	the
Commonwealth to provide interoperability between the Virginia State Police and
with and among localities and other state and federal agencies. 	The hardware
and software has been purchased through federal grants. 						
In order to solidify these various projects an engineer was funded and all
maintenance and administration was assumed by the Communications Division.
The project currently encompasses 116 of 134 localities and a number of state
and federal agencies. 	Discussions with other regions are ongoing. 		There are
currently 170 COMLINC sites in the network. 								
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid
entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The
CAD system consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch terminals and over 100 remote
access users. 	A real time data feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate
rapid response to incidents impacting traffic. 								
The 	Virginia 	State 	Police 	CAD 	Management 	Information 	System 	(MIS) 	is 	a
database containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD since
March 1999. 	CAD historical data is transferred to MIS every two hours. 	The
database currently holds in excess of 14,000,000 records. 	An Intranet Web
page allows VSP network users to create custom queries to obtain desired data
from the database. 		An Intranet website allows users to view real time CAD
incidents. 		The 	MIS 	database 	allows 	the 	Department 	to 	track 	and 	access
information never before available, such as average response times, and total
number of calls. 												
The 	Mobile 	Management 	System 	provides 	support 	for 	over 	2,500 	vehicle
terminals currently deployed. 	The users supported include troopers, other state
agencies, and local sheriffs’ offices and police departments. 	This system allows
user 	access 	to 	VCIN/NCIC, 	text 	messaging; 	and 	for 	the 	troopers, 	full 	CAD
functionality.

Telephone 	systems 	and 		cabling 	have 	been 	replaced 	at 	Administrative
Headquarters with new copper and fiber optic cable service. 	Telephone system
upgrades are continuing as needed at area offices and division headquarters
statewide. 												
In 	addition 	to 	mission-critical 	communications, 	the 	Communications 	Division
coordinates and supports wireless communications equipment and services. 	The
Division constantly monitors wireless services to provide better coverage and
increased technical support. 	This effort supports the current mandated budget
reductions with significant savings to the Department of State Police and the
taxpayers of the Commonwealth. 	These services make Department personnel
more 	accessible 	and 	keep 	them 	better 	informed 	regarding 	routine 	and
administrative activities. 	The number of wireless telephones approved and in
use has been reduced to a little over 900 units in support of recent budget
reductions. 	Current cellular services are allowing the elimination of pagers in
most areas of operations as the wireless carriers build out the more rural areas.
The 	Division 	continues 	to 	provide 	communications 	support 	with 	temporary
systems for special events as they occur. 							
2013 events included: 										
	1. 	Communications 	support 	for 	the 	NASCAR 	races 	held 	twice 	a 	year 	at
		Richmond International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway 			
	2. 	Floydfest Musical Festival 									
	3. 	Numerous local festivals and events requiring security and traffic control
		services, 	including 	the 	NHRA 	Races; 	Urbanna 	Oyster 	Festival; 	Shad
		Planking and various tactical operations 							
	4. 	Security and traffic control for the Virginia State Fair in Caroline County 	
	5. 	Significant resources were deployed for the Presidential Inauguration 		
All field division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by the
Division of Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating 3072 radar
tuning forks. 	The present inventory of active RADARS is approximately 1,649
units and 343 LIDAR units. 	The majority of the Department radars are the
newer Golden Eagle II units. 									
The Division provides statewide telephone services and local area network wiring
for the Department and other state agencies. 	The Division currently maintains
over 60,000 items of STARS equipment. 	Depot level repair will be performed in
the Communications Division, a great savings over all other alternatives.

The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN) activities to
improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 			
The Communications Division serves as Virginia’s Frequency Advisor for the
Association 	of 	Public-Safety 	Communications 	Officials 	(APCO), 	the 	Federal
Communications Commission’s designated agent. The duties include: 		
	• 	Preparation of new and modified FCC license applications for localities and
		agencies throughout the Commonwealth as requested 				
	• 	Coordinate 	applications 	processed 	through 	APCO 	headquarters 		with
		regards 	to 	spectrum 	efficiency, 	coverage 	needs, 	protection 	of
		Commonwealth incumbents and conformance to regulations 			
	• 	Review to accept, deny or comment on applications processed through
		other coordinating agencies for protection of Commonwealth incumbents
		and conformance to regulations

Criminal Justice Information Services Division 				
The 	Criminal 	Justice 	Information 	Services 	Division 	is 	responsible 	for 	the
maintenance 	of 	all 	files 	within 	the 	Department. 		This 	includes 		the
implementation, monitoring, destruction, and archiving of records in accordance
with the State Police Records Retention Schedule. 						
In 2013, the Division processed and responded to 3,807 subpoenas and 934
Freedom of Information Act requests. 							
Central Crim inal R ecords Exchange (CCR E) 						
The 	Criminal 	Investigative 	Reports 	Section 	received 	and 	processed 	237,263
criminal investigative reports in 2013, a decrease of 10.6% from 2012. 		This
decrease is due to a change in business practices with respect to criminal case
file reporting. 	With the implementation of LEAMS, criminal case files are now
completed on an electronic interface. 	The transition to LEAMS has been gradual,
with a scheduled roll out to the field that should be completed by the end of
2014. 	In 2013, 47,013 cases were converted from FACTS to LEAMS and 6,821
new case files were created. 								
In 	2013, 	the 	Central 	Criminal 	Records 	Exchange 	(CCRE) 	received 	1,071
Notifications of Suspected Alien Reporting forms from Virginia probation and
parole officers subsequent to convictions in circuit courts or referrals to probation

or parole officers or for probation supervision, pursuant to Section 19.2-294.2,
Code of Virginia. 													
In 2013, the CCRE completed 3,900 expungements of police and court records,
249 more than in 2012, which represents an increase of 6%. 			
In 2013, the CCRE responded to and completed 161 challenges by citizens to the
existence or accuracy of their criminal history record, a decrease of 31 from
2012. 															
In 2013, the CCRE received 9,173 legal name change court orders, a process
that requires the querying of the Computerized Criminal History (CCH) Name File
in 	order 	to 	determine 	the 	existence 	of 	a 	criminal 	history 	record, 	and 	if
determined, results in the addition of the court-ordered name change to the CCH
Name File, archival of the court order, and notification to the FBI to add the new
name. Criminal history records were identified for 918 of the total name changes
received. 														
In 2013, the CCRE generated 707 Concealed Handgun Permit court notification
letters, a decrease of 455, since 2012. The notifications are routinely made to
the circuit court that issued the permit, the court where the case was or will be
adjudicated, 		with 	a 	copy 		forwarded 	to 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 	of 	the
jurisdiction 	that 	issued 	the 	permit 	and 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 	of 	the
jurisdiction of the adjudicating court. 								
In 2013, the CCRE processed 25,987 adult and juvenile Criminal Justice applicant
and 	National 	Institute 	of 	Standards 	Technology 	(NIST) 	cards. 	Scanning
equipment 	is 	used 	to 	scan 	the 	mug 	shot 	and 	fingerprint 	card 	barcodes.
Demographics are entered manually from the print cards into the CCH file. 	The
total for 2012 was 23,863. 										
Non-Crim inal Justice I nterface (NCJI ) 						
The Non-Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 82,707 fingerprint-based
searches and 253,517 name search requests for 2013. On February 8, 1996, the
Non-Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant
growth 	and 	demand 	for 		criminal 	history 	record 	requests. 	This 	interface
eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process a high volume
of “paper record name-search” requests. 							
In 2013, CCRE staff processed 104,665 paper inquiries or 41.3% and 148,852 or
58.7% electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average
response time of 72 hours or less. 	Of the total paper record name search
requests, 76,758 or 73.3% inquiries were submitted on the bar-coded criminal
												15 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s

Table: 16
history request forms and the remaining 27,907 or 26.7% were submitted on the
non bar-coded forms. 								
The 	bar-code 	method 	of 	automation 	has 	tremendously 	enhanced 	customer
service by reducing turnaround time. 						
M ental Health File 								
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the
ability to purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these
categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an
individual 	(1) 	acquitted 	by 	reason 	of 	insanity, 	(2) 	involuntarily 	admitted 	to
inpatient 	or 	outpatient 	treatment, 		(3) 	adjudicated 		mentally 	incapacitated 	or
incompetent, or (4) is the subject of a temporary detention order (TDO) and
agreed to voluntary admission. 	As of December 31, 2013, there were 18,656
mental health records added bringing the total records on file to 202,389. 	These
figures are based on the new GRI (Global Recording Interface) Report, which
captures information in real time and has replaced the older reporting process.
In 2013, the CCRE received 82 notifications of restoration of capacity or right to
purchase, possess or transport a firearm. Reviewing this file when an application
to purchase is being processed has prevented the transfer of a firearm in 316
instances in 2013. 								
Sex Offender and Crim es Against M inors R egistry (SOR ) 		
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for
employment-licensure purposes has increased. 				
		 	The SOR experienced a 15.9% increase 				
		 	In 2013, there were 208,317 searches 				
		 	An increase of 28,511 searches compared to 2012 			
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular,
by 	providing 	personal 	descriptive 	and 	sentencing 	information 	on 	individuals
convicted of certain sex crimes. 	Information regarding registered offenders
which includes a photograph is maintained on the internet. 			
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 25,752 fingerprint-based registrations
received since July 1, 1997. 							
	 	Fingerprint registrations decreased from 5.8% in 2012 to 5.4% in 2013. 	
The Sex Offender I nvestigative Unit 					
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit conducts criminal investigations related to
offenders required to register. 	In 2013, 2,935 criminal investigations were
initiated, which is an 11.0% increase from 2012. 				
										16 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 17 of 53”
Table: 17
The Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual and sexually violent offenders.
Registered offenders require semi-annual address verification and an additional
verification within 30 days of a change to their home or employment address
information. 		During 2013, troopers and compliance officers confirmed 21,174
addresses, which represent an 8.3% increase in verifications from 2012. 	
The Suprem e Court/ State P olice Disposition I nterface 				
The Interface consists of 123 Circuit Courts, 132 General District Courts, and 124
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE.
In 2013, an estimated 433,971 records were successfully transmitted, negating
the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to
CCRE. Of all dispositions transmitted, an estimated 4.5% were rejected. 	
In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented.
Designed 	to 	reduce 	human 	intervention, 	notifications 	are 	automatically
generated for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 							
For 2013, notifications to law enforcement agencies for 1,300 individual charges
were generated. 	The notifications were generated because the court did/could
not include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data or when
the court transmitted the Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a
corresponding fingerprint card on file. 								
The Correctional Status I nform ation (CSI ) I nterface 				
As 	of 	December 	31, 	2013, 	there 	were 	141,918 	offenders 	on 	file 	with
commitments 	received 	from 	the 	Virginia 	Department 	of 	Corrections, 	which
accounts for 7.06% of the total records maintained in the CCRE. 				
The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information Interface
improved the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional
information with minimal error. 									
The M icrofilm Section 										
This section archived 499,072 documents during 2013, a decrease of 323,991
documents, or 39% since 2012. 									
P hotographic Laboratory 										
The 	Photo 	Lab 	maintains 	records, 	files, 	film, 	and 	responds 	to 	requests 	for
photographs, digital images, and court enlargements. 	In 2013, there were
150,209 photographic prints, an increase of 7,053, developed for use by sworn
personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal
									17 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s

cases in 2013. 	The lab also received and processed 549 compact discs (CD), an
increase of 84.2%. 										
The Autom ated Fingerprint I dentification System (AFI S) 			
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and palm
prints 	from 	criminal 	arrests, 	sex 	offenders 	and 	partial 	latent 	fingerprints
recovered from crime scenes. The central components of this system are located
at State Police Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state
and local agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their
respective 		agencies. 	The 	Global 	Transaction 	Controller 	receives 	Live 	Scan
transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, Sex Offender Registry
(SOR), Consolidated Applicant Tracking System (CATS), and AFIS systems for
searching existing criminal history records or to match latent fingerprints against
known criminal prints. 	The installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive
System has enhanced our ability to store and retrieve these records. 	Currently
there are 2,242,054 Virginia unique subject-related fingerprint files as part of
AFIS. 	Additionally, there are 139,432 unsolved latent fingerprints and 8,466
unsolved palm prints in the database. 	The Slap database has 1,069,730 images;
the Palm database has 275,946 images. 						
During 2013, the fingerprint section processed 297,462 (Inked cards and Live
Scan) 	criminal 	arrest 	records. 	The 	Live 	Scan 	volume 	was 	286,015 	records
(96.2%) and the card scan volume was 11,447 records. 	The fingerprints section
processed 174,994 fingerprint based applicant requests including criminal justice
requests. 	The Live Scan portion of the civil requests totaled 143,058 or 81.75%
and the mailed-in cards totaled 31,936. 						
Virginia Firearm s Transaction P rogram (VFTP ) 					
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except
antiques, based on the results of a criminal history record information check on
the buyer. 		The VFTP processed 479,253 transactions in 2013. 	Of these, 2,412
were denied based on the results of a criminal history record check or the
identification of another disqualifying record. 						
During 	2013, 	168 	wanted 	persons 	were 	identified 	for 	extraditable 	offenses,
which 	resulted 	in 	the 	arrest 	of 	124 	individuals 	wanted 	in 	Virginia 	and 	5
individuals who were named in an outstanding warrant from another state. 	In
2013, the State Police requested 961 criminal investigations related to the illegal
sale or attempt to purchase firearms, which resulted in 654 (68%) closed arrests.
VCheck 												
VCheck 	is 	Virginia’s 	Internet-based 	Instant 	Background 	Check 	program.
Approval numbers are generated in instant clearances, while transactions that
require review or research are routed to the Firearms Transaction Call Center for
								18 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s

processing. 	During 	calendar 	year 	2013, 	approximately 	94% 	of 	the 	total
transactions, 	statewide, 	were 	processed 	via 	the 	Internet. 		As on-line 		users
increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and
verification 	processes. 	Additional 	employee 	time 	devoted 	to 	these 		other
processes provide more efficient overall services to the firearm dealers and
firearm purchasers and cost savings to the Department and the Commonwealth.
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of
a gun dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller
identification number for qualified employees. 	As of December 31, 2012, the
State Police has issued 13,425 seller identification numbers. 					
Concealed Handgun P erm its 										
Since July 1, 1995, 731,912 concealed handgun permits have been issued as
authorized by Section 18.2-308.02, Code of Virginia; 98,163 were issued in 2013
by Virginia Circuit Courts. In 2013, the State Police notified the Circuit Courts in
2,383 instances of disqualified holders of concealed handgun permits, of which
923 were revoked. 		During 2013, 5,495 nonresident concealed handgun permits
were issued by the State Police, which is a 77% increase in the volume of
nonresident permits issued in 2012. 		Additionally, in 2013, the State Police
revoked 	9 	non-resident 	concealed 	handgun 		permits 	upon 	the 	holder’s
disqualification. 												
In accordance with the Code of Virginia, the State Police enters the permit
holder’s 	name 	and 	description 	in 	the 	Virginia 	Criminal 	Information 	Network
(VCIN) so that the permit's existence and current status will be made known to
law-enforcement personnel accessing the Network for investigative purposes. 	As
of December 31, 2013, there were 358,070 active concealed handgun permits
issued by Virginia circuit courts maintained in VCIN. 						
Uniform Crim e/ I ncident Based R eporting (UCR / I BR ) 					
The Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) Section is responsible
for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing
law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 Group A criminal offenses
as well as 12 Group B criminal offenses. 	The UCR/IBR office no longer accepts
summary hardcopy reports or data submitted by diskettes. 	Data is submitted via
the Internet through the IBR Website. 	This is a secure system to which only
State Program personnel and contributing agencies have access. 	Each day
submitted files are run through the edit process. 		This procedure generates an
error report so that agencies may correct any incidents that failed to be sent to
the 	IBR 	central 	repository 	database. 	A 	monthly 	file 	of 	Virginia’s 	data 	is
generated and emailed to the National Program (FBI) for inclusion in their annual
publication, Crime in the United States . 									
									19 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 20 of 53”
Table: 20
During 2013, the UCR/IBR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with
training 	issues, 	interpretation 	of 	error 	reports, 	and 	clarifications 		in 	offense
definitions and reporting procedures, as well as assisted computer software
vendors 	with 	reporting 	issues. 	Agencies 	were 	asked 	to 	review 	over 	10,000
offenses 	regarding 	quality 	control 	issues, 	make 	the 	necessary 	changes 	and
resubmit their data. 													
The IBR responded to an estimated 2,100 phone calls regarding various IBR
issues 	from 	agencies 	and 	vendors 	as 	well 	as 	receiving 	or 	sending 	2,970
messages using electronic mail. 											
There are 17 private vendors with software that transforms agency crime data
into an approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their
own in-house software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly statistical reports are
now 	posted 	on 	the 	IBR 	Website 	rather 	than 	having 	to 	be 	mailed 		to 	each
contributing agency. 	The UCR/IBR office responded daily to requests for crime
statistics from state agencies, government officials, students, media, and the
general public. 													
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter as well as the annual
report, Crime in Virginia. 	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges, legislators, and
other state agencies are also informed of the availability of Crime in Virginia. 	In
2004, this annual report was published for the first time on a CD rather than
hardcopy. 	Beginning in 2007, the annual report has been available exclusively
through 	the 	State 	Police 	Website. 	This 	report 	contains 	Group 	A 		offenses
submitted by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B
arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	These data comprise the official crime
statistics for Virginia and are used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate
forecasting, and in the legislative process. 									
The IBR contributing agency Website went into production in 2002. 		Currently,
there are 285 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through
the 	Internet. 		This 	Website 	provides 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	with 	the
convenience 	of 	on-line 	monthly 	data 	submission, 	receiving 	timely 		error
notifications, monthly and year-to-date statistical reports, performing searches
and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals, bulletins, and posting inquiries in the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. 									
The 2013 Crime in Virginia report will be available in the spring of 2014. Since
2008, this report has been formatted and published within the IBR Unit which
has reduced expenses and provides an earlier distribution date.

Virginia 	Crim inal 	I nform ation 	Netw ork 	(VCI N) 	/ 	National 	Crim e
I nform ation Center (NCI C) 								
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 711 member agencies with 34,818 certified
operators. 	The system has 15,994 terminals, of which 3,862 are fixed terminals
and 	12,132 	are 	mobile 	terminals. 	In 	2013, 	VCIN 	processed 	446,662,941
transactions (an increase of 3.4% over the 2012 totals) between NCIC/ National
Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) member agencies and
state computer databases. 									
Virginia 	agencies 	entered 	numerous 	types 	of 	information 	in 	the 	VCIN/NCIC
system, which is critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these
systems store information relating to wanted persons, missing persons, stolen
vehicles and protective orders. 								
Enhancements in the “E-Magistrate” and “Hotfiles” systems have improved the
statistical information available through VCIN/NCIC. 	In 2013 there were 179,145
warrants 	entered 	into 	the 	VCIN/NCIC 	system. 	VCIN/NCIC 	currently 	retains
Virginia information for 1,751 missing adults, 9,172 missing children, and 8,478
stolen vehicles. 										
In 2009, for the first time, system enhancements allowed VCIN to track the
number of protective order transactions throughout the period instead of the
number of orders on file at any given time. 	In 2013 there were 13,291 Orders of
Protection, 	19,415 	Preliminary 	Protective 	Orders, 		and 	49,430 	Emergency
Protective Orders entered into the VCIN system. 					
E-M agistrate 											
In 2009, the Supreme Court of Virginia implemented an automated interface
named E-Magistrate. 	This automated interface permits warrants and Protective
Orders issued by magistrates to be automatically entered into VCIN and NCIC.
This streamlined process ensures that data is available to law enforcement within
thirty minutes of the issuance of the aforementioned legal documents. 	In 2013
there were 108,915 records entered into VCIN/NCIC through this interface. 	
Availability of Departm ent of M otor Vehicle I m ages via VCI N 	
Virginia DMV images are available to Virginia law enforcement agencies through
the Virginia State Police, Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) using the
OpenFox Messenger application. 	Alternatively, they will be available to interface
agencies 	that 	have 	completed 	the 	programming 	to 	their 	VCIN 	interface 	as
advised. 	In 2013, the VCIN system processed an average of over 111,437
requests per month from law enforcement agencies for DMV images.

Virginia M issing Children I nform ation Clearinghouse 				
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse was formed by an act of
the Virginia General Assembly on July 1, 1983. 	The clearinghouse is to assist in
the implementation of federal and state laws relating to missing children, and the
inclusion of programs to coordinate efforts between local, state, and federal
agencies in recovering missing children and promoting community awareness of
the issue. 	The Clearinghouse operates as Virginia’s center for missing children
administered through the Virginia Department of State Police. The clearinghouse
is linked to all Virginia law enforcement agencies through the VCIN system and
all United States police agencies through NCIC and the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children. 										
Virginia Am ber Alert System 									
A 	new 	system 	was 	developed 	in 	March 	2006 	to 	automate 	the 	entry 	and
notification process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 	The system is designed to
provide a comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the
safe recovery of a child and capture of the abductor. 	Local law enforcement
agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request form, enter the
information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 	The system has
significantly reduced the time required to get this information out to the public.
In 2013, 5 requests were received for an Amber Alert activation and no requests
met the criteria and were activated. 	For 2 Amber Alert requests, the abducted
child was located just prior to the activation of an Amber Alert. 	In the 3 cases
where the criterion was not met, no Endangered Missing Child Alerts were
issued. 													
Virginia Senior Alert P rogram 									
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia General Assembly created the
Virginia Senior Alert Program. 	This program, managed by the Criminal Justice
Information Services Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police
to 	publicize 	an 	incident 	of 	a 	missing 	senior 	adult. 	When 	activated, 	the
information is publicized at www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our
media partners. In 2013, the Senior Alert process was activated on 6 occasions
out of 13 requests. 												
Property and Finance Division 								
The 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	encompasses 	a 	wide 	range 	of 	property
management, 	logistical 	and 	financial 	functions. 	It 	was 	responsible 	for 	the
procurement, warehousing and distribution of more than $45,098,254 in supplies
and equipment in FY 2013. 	The Property and Finance Division is also responsible
for the management and maintenance of 118 buildings and grounds across the
state.

The 	Public 	Safety 	Driver 	Training 	Facility, 	located 	in 	Nottoway 	County, 	is
operational. 	The 	Department 	also 	has 	a 	new 		Target 	Firing 	Range 	under
construction 	which 	is 	located 	adjacent 		to 	the 	Driver 	Training 	Facility.
Additionally, 	a 	new 	BCI 	office 	located 	near 	Castlewood, 	Virginia, 	is 	under
construction. 		The 	Department 	has 	acquired 	an 	existing 	office 	building 	in
Wytheville 		which 	will 	be 	the 	new 	location 	for 	the 	Wytheville 	Area 	Office.
Additionally, office buildings are being attained in Harrisonburg and the Luray
area to replace existing facilities. 										
The Property and Finance Division oversees the mailroom and printing sections
which processed 309,961 pieces of mail during 2013 and printed 2,450,954
copies. In 2013, $676,000 was spent in postage. 						
The Property 	and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess
Military Property Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to
procure, at no cost, military property and equipment that is in excess of the
Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as
the point of contact, and provides a state coordinator. 	The program serves over
290 Virginia law enforcement agencies, and in 2013, the program distributed
goods valued over $2,558,800. 										
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-
to-day operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement
Program, 	“The 	1122 	Program.” 	This 		program 	allows 	state 	and 	local 	law
enforcement 	agencies 	to 	purchase 	law 	enforcement 	equipment 	suitable 	for
counter-narcotic 	activities 	through 	the 	federal 		procurement 		channels 	at
substantial 		savings. 	During 	2013, 	over 	$388,141.42 	worth 	of 	goods 	were
purchased through this program, saving the Department $39,170. 			
The Property and Finance Division is also responsible for the preparation of
monitoring and accounting for the Department’s annual budget in excess of $293
million for FY 2013, including approximately $12 million of federal grants. 	VSP
requested appropriation changes of $19M through the Department of Planning
and Budget 	which included operational, 	capital, federal 	grant 	and equitable
sharing. 															
The Property and Finance Division processes payments to vendors in accordance
with established policies and procedures issued by various entities, including, but
not 	limited 	to 	the 	State 	Department 		of 	Accounts 	and 	Federal 	agencies.
Payments are processed in compliance with the “Prompt Payment Act.” 	The
Prompt Payment Statutes (Code of Virginia, Sections 2.2-4347 through 2.2-4356
and 	2.2-5004) 	promote 	sound 	cash 		management 	and 	improved 	vendor
relationships 	by 	ensuring 	timely 	payments 	for 	goods 	and 	services. 	The
											23 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 24 of 53”
Table: 24
Department maintained a Prompt Payment compliance rate of 98.98% on 36,415
total payments for Fiscal Year 2013. 									
Security, patrol services and background information are routinely provided to
other state agencies, localities and private entities for which the Department
seeks reimbursement. 	The Property and Finance Division, along with other
Divisions of the Department, bills for these services provided by the Department.
It 	is 	the 	responsibility 	of 	the 	Property 	and 	Finance 		Division 	to 	collect 	the
receivables and record deposits to the proper accounts. 	When collections are
not timely, the Department pursues alternative solutions to collect on bad debt,
including Debt Set-Off through the Department of Taxation and other collection
alternatives 	through 	the 	Office 	of 	the 	Attorney 	General 	– 	Division 	of 	Debt
Collection. 	During Fiscal Year 2013, the Department had billings from all sources
totaling $54.9M, with collections from all sources totaling $55.7M for a June
accounts receivable balance of $5.7M. 									
The Federal Emergency Management Agency offers the Public Assistance grant
program during federally declared disasters. 	Public Assistance is available to
public 	entities 	and 	funds 	the 	removal 	of 	debris 	and 	emergency 	protective
measures along with the repair, restoration, reconstruction or replacement of
approximately 	$32,483 	related 	to 	August 	2011 	Irene; 	$11,272 	related 	to
Earthquake 2011; $15,548 related to Lee 2011; and $32K related to Severe
Storms 2012. 													
The Property and Finance Division is responsible for the accounting of drug-
related seizures in accordance with applicable state and federal guidelines and
reporting requirements. 	The Property and Finance Division is also charged with
managing 	the 	awarded 	$44 	million 	settlement 	related 	to 	the 	Purdue
Pharmaceutical case. 	During Fiscal Year 2012, the United States Department of
Justice (USDOJ) completed a review of the Virginia State Police’s compliance with
requirements of the DOJ Equitable Sharing Program as set forth in the Guide to
Equitable 	Sharing 	for 	State 	and 	Local 	Law 	Enforcement 	Agencies 	(Guide),
reporting that the receipts and expenditures of DOJ equitable sharing funds were
properly supported and used for permissible purposes; and the internal controls
pertaining to these monies were adequately designed and operating effectively.
The Property and Finance Division prepares all state and federal reporting in
compliance 	with 	applicable 	State 	and 	Federal 	regulations, 	including 	but 	not
limited to the Commonwealth Accounting Policies and Procedures (CAPP) Manual
and the Financial Reporting Directive issued by the State Comptroller (which
includes 		the 	relevant 	generally 		accepted 	accounting 	principles 	and 	the
accounting 	pronouncements 	from 	the 	Governmental 		Accounting 	Standards
Board); and the Federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars for
state and local governments.

The State Comptroller promulgates internal control programs under the authority
of the Code of Virginia, §§ 2.2-800 and 2.2-803. 		The definitive source for
internal control in the Commonwealth is the Agency Risk Management and
Internal Control Standards (ARMICS). 	Along with VSP’s Office of Performance
Management and Internal Controls (OPMIC), the Property and Finance Division
continually 	reviews 	policies 	and 	procedures 	to 		ensure 	the 	Department’s
compliance with ARMICS. 										
Information Technology Division 							
The 	Information 	Technology 	Division 	(IT) 	maintains 	hardware 	and 	software
infrastructure 	in 	support 	of 	Virginia 	State 	Police's 	mission 	and 	service 	to 	the
citizens of the Commonwealth. 	Additionally, the 	IT 	Division 	is responsible for
implementation 	and 	maintenance 	of 	many 	mission 	critical 	applications 	which
support local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. These include: the
Centralized Criminal History (CCH), Automated Fingerprint Identification System
(AFIS), 	Firearms 	Transaction 	Center, 	Computerized 	Applicant 		Tracking, 	Sex
Offender Registry, Amber Alert and many more. 							
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 							
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest
information, including fingerprints, mug shots and palm prints, to the State Police
and the FBI. 	This process enhances an agency’s ability to detect aliases and
outstanding warrants on arrestees prior to their release. 	Fingerprint-based civil
requests are also submitted electronically and provide the requesting agency
with state and FBI responses within 24 hours. 							
During 2013, criminal arrest records and identification bookings were received
and processed from 225 unique Live Scan units throughout the state. 	Likewise,
Correctional records on inmates and probation and parolees were received and
processed 	from 	59 	Live 	Scan 	units. 	In 	2013, 	96.1% 	of 	the 	criminal 		and
correctional transactions processed were received through Live Scan. 		
During 2013, civil submissions were received and processed from a total of 400
unique live scan units; some of these being criminal justice units also used for
the purposes of submitting criminal justice applicants. 	Eighty-two percent of the
civil transactions processed during 2013 were received through Live Scan.

requester by at least seven days. 							
Central Crim inal I m age System (CCI S) 						
CCIS receives mug shots and images of scars, marks and tattoos from the AFIS
system. 	Virginia law enforcement agency personnel log in to search for images
of known offenders by State ID (SID) or for suspects by characteristics such as
height and weight range, race, gender, eye color, hair color, etc. 	They can
create lineups, reports, and run facial recognition searches. 	In 2013, 144,416
records with a total of 290,452 images were added to the system by AFIS. Sixty-
nine agencies have access to CCIS, and their users logged in 3,608 times and

Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) 						
This is an insurance industry-funded program established in 1992 by Section
38.2-414 of the Code of Virginia to receive motor vehicle theft-related tips and to
provide 	cash 	rewards 	to 	the 	callers. 	The 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 	also 	provides
leadership and assistance to more than 175 state and local law enforcement
agencies 	throughout 	Virginia 		by 	providing 	training; 	conducting 	promotional
events, prevention seminars and VIN Etching events; offering grant funding; and
procuring specialized equipment. 									
H.E.A.T. conducts basic and advanced motor vehicle theft investigation schools
for law enforcement, as well as instruction in motor vehicle theft prevention to
crime prevention specialists and Operation HEATWave Coordinators throughout
the year. To enhance Virginia’s vehicle theft investigative abilities, the H.E.A.T.
office provides training scholarships for local investigators to receive specialized

Table: 35
The H.E.A.T. office also coordinates the deployment of bait cars, motorcycles
and scooters in high theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on thieves. 	
The 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 	works 	to 	increase 	the 	public’s 	awareness 	about 	the
problem of motor vehicle theft, theft prevention devices and strategies by using
a variety of marketing approaches including television, billboard and banner
advertising 	as 	well 	as 	social 	media. 	Citizens 	are 	directed 	to 	visit
HeatReward.com, 	for 	additional 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 	information 	and 	to 	report
suspected motor vehicle theft. Individuals can also call the H.E.A.T. Hotline, 1-
800-947-HEAT (4328), if they have any motor vehicle theft-related information.
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted
in a momentous reduction in Virginia’s vehicle theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s
motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000 residents has declined by approximately 68
percent. 												
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) 							
In 1999, the General Assembly approved the establishment of an Insurance
Fraud Investigative Program within the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. This
program 	is 	funded 	by 	an 	assessment 	on 	property 	and 	casualty 	insurance
premiums. The purpose of the program is to: 						
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when
	the Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or
	is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the
	extent of such insurance fraud; 							
2. 	Respond to notifications or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by
	federal, 	state 	and 	local 	police, 	other 		law-enforcement 	authorities,
	governmental agencies or Units, and any other person; 				
3. 	Review 	notices 	and 	reports 	of 	insurance 	fraud; 	select 	the 	incidents 	of
	suspected fraud that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation;
	and conduct the investigations. 							
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by
the total amount of claimed loss actually received by individuals submitting
suspected 	insurance 	fraud 	claims. 	During 	2013, 	more 	than 	$3 	million 	was
actually collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud, and the total
amount involved in suspicious claims attempted, but not collected, was more
$11.5 million. 											
It has been estimated insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as
$1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services. 	This Program is dedicated
								35 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 36 of 53”
Table: 36
to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens
of Virginia as well as raising public awareness about insurance fraud. This is
accomplished 	through 	several 	marketing 	strategies 	including 	the 	website
StampOutFraud.com, banner advertising and social media. Citizens can also call
a toll-free hotline, 1-877-62FRAUD (1-877-623-7283), with information about
suspected insurance fraud. 									
A reward program has been established to provide rewards of up to $25,000 to
citizens 	who 	report 	information 	leading 	to 	the 	arrest 	and/or 	conviction 	of
individuals committing insurance fraud. 	Since its inception, the program has paid
out over $80,000 to individuals who reported suspected insurance fraud. 		
During 2013, 1,994 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance
fraud were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and
general public. There were 457 criminal investigations initiated by the Special
Agents, and 360 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. Three hundred
insurance 	fraud 	cases 	were 	prosecuted, 	which 	resulted 	in 	court-ordered
restitution of more than $255,000.00 during 2013. 					
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 						
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance
abuse 	laws. 	The 	Section 	remains 	committed 	to 	its 	support 	of 	local 	law
enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional
field offices also help in this effort by supporting special operations initiated by
other law enforcement entities. 								
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and
civilian support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 					
• 	DES Regional Field Offices 									
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 								
• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 								
• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 						
• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations 									
• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 								
In 	2013, 	DES 	field 	offices 	participated 	in 	1,293 	investigations 	that 	yielded
$9,286,043 in seized narcotics, $338,321 in seized currency, and 169 persons
arrested on 266 felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 686 persons
were arrested on 1,283 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES
assisted other agencies. 	Special Agents also seized 7 vehicles and 94 weapons.
Additionally, 408 clandestine labs were dismantled by Department personnel. 	
								36 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 37 of 53”
Table: 37
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – During 	2013, 	DES 	participated 	in 	38
federal, 	state 	and 	local 	multi-jurisdictional 	task 	forces, 	encompassing 	106
jurisdictions. 	These 	multi-jurisdictional 		task 	forces 	participated 	in 	6,154
investigations that accounted for $14,465,247 in illicit drug seizures, $905,320 in
seized U.S. currency, and 3,398 persons arrested on 4,365 charges. 	These task
forces also seized 83 vehicles and 405 weapons. 								
Marijuana 	Eradication 	Program 	- 	The 	Commonwealth 	remains 	a 	prime
location for the cultivation of 	the marijuana plant, with 	domestically grown
marijuana having the potential for being a major cash crop. 	With DEA funding,
the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local
law enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard, conduct a
regular program to eradicate domestically-grown marijuana. 	In 2013, the State
Police and local law enforcement agencies found 10,467 plants in 118 outdoor
plots. There were also 1,738 marijuana plants eradicated in 39 indoor grows.
Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 139 arrests. 	Seizures included 250
weapons valued at $12,529.00. 	Vehicles and other personal property seized
valued 	$865,885.00. 	Processed 	marijuana 	seized 	exceeded 	523 	pounds.
Considering the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the
cash value of marijuana not reaching the streets as a result of eradication would
be in excess of $38 million. 													
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) - The GIANT
mission is to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member
agencies. The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 								
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana,
	both 	indoor 	and 	outdoor, 	with 	the 	eradication 	of 	this 	marijuana 	and
	successful prosecution of the growers as a primary goal; 				
2. 	Developing 	intelligence 	concerning 		air 	smuggling 	into 	Virginia 	using
	contacts 	to 	monitor 	suspicious 	activities 	of 	all 	known 	airports 	in 	the
	Commonwealth, 	and 	by 	locating 	clandestine 	airstrips 	and 	identifying
	users; 															
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within
	the 	Commonwealth 	by 	interdicting 		drug 	shipments 	via 	land, 	air, 	and
	waterway; 														
4. 	Developing 	procedures 	that 	eliminate 	duplication 	of 	activities 	and
	breakdowns in communication among the various state agencies and law
	enforcement authorities, and; 											
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the
	maximum extent possible. 												
										37 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 38 of 53”
Table: 38
GIANT performed 357 operations during 2013 that resulted in 147 arrests, and
the 	seizure 	of 	$35,698,433.00 	worth 	of 	narcotics. 	GIANT 	also 	netted 	149
weapons, 5 vehicles, and $592,379.00 in U.S. currency. 				
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents
work 	with 	the 	Drug 	Enforcement 	Administration, 	the 	Department 	of 	Health
Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law
enforcement agencies to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit
purposes. 											
During 	2013, 	Drug 	Diversion 	received 	643 complaints 	of 	diversion 	activities
throughout 	the 	Commonwealth. 	In 	response 	to 	these 	complaints, 	1317
investigations were initiated. A total of 636 persons were arrested on 1,063
charges. Additionally, 46 search warrants were executed during the past year. 	A
major educational 	role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law 	enforcement
officials about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions
and what they can do about it. This role also included educating health care
professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the
problem and the importance of self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their
individual health care delivery systems. During 2013, 16 presentations were
conducted for 464 healthcare professionals. The Drug Diversion Unit (DDU), with
assistance 	from 	the 	National 	Association 	of 	Drug 	Diversion 	Investigators
(N.A.D.D.I.), hosted the Thirteenth Annual Drug Diversion School in Virginia
Beach, Virginia. 										
Additionally, the DDU is tasked with ensuring that all pharmacies and retailers,
who offer for purchase any pseudoephedrine or ephedrine products, comply with
the new Virginia Methamphetamine Precursor Law. 					
Criminal Intelligence Division 							
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify,
document, analyze, and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons
involved in criminal activity to include terrorism. 	CID is currently composed of
three units; the Field Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Virginia Fusion Center (VFC)
and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). 						
The FIU interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect and
provide intelligence, including information on current investigations. 	The unit is
active in each of the Department’s seven field divisions. 	The FIU also has five
agents assigned to the various FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces. 			
The VFC operates the Terrorism Hotline and the Drug/Gang Hotline, which are
initiatives that provide a conduit for the public to provide information on both
terrorist and criminal activities. 	The Homeland Security Information Network,
									38 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 39 of 53”
Table: 39
Virginia Portal (HSIN-VA) allows for public and private entities that have a need
and right to access certain databases a method of retrieving common operating
picture 	information. 	During 	2013, 	VFC 	responded 	to 	2388 	requests 	for
information 	(RFI’s) 	from 	federal, 	state 	and 	local 	law 	enforcement 	agencies
located inside and outside of the Commonwealth. 	Additionally, the VFC provided
multiple training classes to 225 state and local government personnel concerning
the management and protection of national security information. 			
The VFC’s Critical Infrastructure Key Resource (CIKR) focuses on detecting,
deterring, 	and 	mitigating 	natural 		and 	manmade 	incidents 	impacting 		the
Commonwealth. 	This is accomplished by identifying, collecting and analyzing
key assets and dependencies, suspicious activity reports and trend data. 		This
data is then shared with federal, state, and local entities to prevent or more
efficiently manage incident scenes. 									
The purpose of the Fusion Liaison Training Program (FLTP) is to provide local,
state 	and 	federal 	agencies 	with 	an 	increased 	intelligence 	capability, 	and 	to
provide a statewide reporting and trend analysis capability to our partners. 		The
FLTP 	enhances 	Intelligence 	led 	policing, 	which 	is 	a 	concept 	by 	which 	law
enforcement and other first responder agencies pool information and utilize
predictive analysis to ultimately prevent criminal activity rather than respond to
it. The FLTP conducted 8 Basic Classes of the Fusion Liaison Officer course.
These sessions occurred in Fairfax, Smithfield, Roanoke, Bristol, Harrisonburg,
Quantico, Virginia Beach and Weyers Cave. This 16 hour course of instruction
includes 	topics 	such 		as 	domestic 	and 	international 	terrorism 	awareness,
suspicious activity recognition and reporting, outlaw motorcycle gangs, sovereign
citizens and fusion center operations. 	Over the course of the 8 classes, we
designated 281 individuals as Fusion Liaison Officers bringing our total number to
803 since the inception of the program in 2010. While our Basic Course is the
premier 	event 		of 	our 	program, 	the 	bulk 	of 	our 	outreach 	comes 	through
presentations, briefings, coordination meetings and teachings to both the public
and private sector. 2013 was very busy as we conducted 42 presentations
reaching over 2,000 individuals on a variety of topics. Our audience consisted of
federal agencies, school administrators and security officers, fire and rescue
response personnel, crime prevention specialists, intelligence analysts, corporate
security 	and 	members 	of 	the public. 	Our topics 	included 	suspicious 	activity
reporting, interagency liaison, human intelligence, school threat assessments,
crime prevention, critical infrastructure protection and terror bombing incident
response. 														
The 	Criminal 		Intelligence 	Division 		also 	supports 	the 	Federal 	Bureau 	of
Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF). 		These regionally assigned
special agents work full time with the FBI on terrorism related investigations.

Table: 41
Technical Support Section - The personnel in this section provide technical
and surveillance support to local, state, and federal law enforcement. 	In 2013,
this 	section 	provided 	199 	hours 	of 	training, 	handled 	104 	cases, 	and 	2,027
requests for service. 	Services include responding to 28 hostage/barricaded
subject 	incidents, 	and 	93 	requests 	for 	courtroom 	closed-circuit 	audio/video
systems in child victim cases. The section also performed enhancement services
on 37 audio/video files and installed 159 video systems. 	The complex and covert
nature of this special group has been instrumental in the successful investigation
and prosecution of numerous criminal matters and is absolutely essential to the
continued success of the organization’s mission. 					
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 		
CCI was established in 2003 to suppress criminal activity with specific emphasis
focused on reducing the flow of illegal narcotics on the Virginia highways, public
transportation systems, schools and parcel distribution businesses. 	Additionally,
CCI provides seven regional response teams to address chemical, nuclear and
bio-terrorism events. 	In 2005, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new
strategic initiative developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-
related crimes. 										
Gang Initiative - The State Police is committed to the disruption of illegal gang
activity and significant criminal enterprises that operate in the Commonwealth of
Virginia, 	through 	a 	multi-faceted 		approach 	of 	intelligence 	management,
investigation, and education. 	The strategies are designed to identify, analyze,
and suppress gang members participating in illicit activities. 	In 2013, members
initiated 	510 	investigations, 	arrested 	633 	individuals 	involving 	1,102 	felony
charges and 623 misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 127 guns were seized along
with narcotics valued at $1,746,038.

Bureau of Field Operations 						
(BFO) 													
				A 40 year veteran, Lt. Col. George L. Daniels, Jr., was
				appointed the Director of the Bureau of Field Operations
				upon the retirement of Lt. Colonel Eugene Stockton in
				December 	2013. 	He 	previously 	served 		as 	the 	Deputy
				Director prior to his promotion. The BFO Director oversees
				the 	management 	of 	all 	aspects 	of 	highway 	safety 	in
				conjunction with BFO Division Commanders and other law
				enforcement agencies. His Bureau is also responsible for
traffic law enforcement, aviation support to local agencies and the coordination
of public safety in times of civil disturbances and disasters. 				
The Bureau of Field Operations is primarily responsible for patrolling more than
64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways in Virginia. Uniform
State 	Police 	personnel 	provide 	both 	traffic 	enforcement 	and 	criminal 	law
enforcement 	as 	the 	need 	arises 	and 	based 	upon 	the 	ability 	of 	local 	law
enforcement to respond. The bureau is responsible for managing the Motor
Vehicle Safety Inspection Program which enforces motor carrier and commercial
										43 | F a c t s 		a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 44 of 53”
Table: 44
vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides aerial support for
law enforcement activities and emergency medical evacuations. 			
The 	Commonwealth's 	geography 	and 	size 	dictate 	the 	need 	to 	decentralize
uniformed police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further
subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or
counties. Staffing is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and
county level. 											
Enforcement 	Initiatives 	to 	Enhance 	Highway 	Safety 	and
Public Safety 										
Checkpoint Strikeforce 										
Identifying and removing drunk drivers from the highways of the Commonwealth
of Virginia is a primary objective of State Police Troopers in their goal to provide
the safest highway system in our nation. Checkpoint Strikeforce is a 		
high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that involves saturation 		
patrols 	and 	DUI 	sobriety 	checkpoints 	every 	week 	on 	specific 		
highways 	and 	in 	locations 	where 	alcohol 	related 	incidents 	and 		
arrests have been identified. This national campaign is supported by 		
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and 		
involves significant public education and awareness, and strict DUI 		
enforcement. 											
During 2013, a total of 696 vehicles passed through DUI sobriety checkpoints
and saturation patrols resulting in 195 drunk driving arrests. DUI saturation
patrols 	were 	conducted 	on 	Interstates, 		primary 	and 	secondary 	highways
throughout 	Virginia 	resulting 	in 	the 	arrest 	of 	684 	motorists 	for 	violations
including 19,078 for speed, 7,454 reckless drivers, 42 suspended or revoked
drivers, 2,083 seatbelt violations and 618 drivers for child safety seat violations.
Operation Air, Land, and Speed 								
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and
implemented 	an 	enforcement 	plan 	in 	July, 	2006, 	to 	effectively 	reduce 	and
eliminate vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The
effort was also intended to combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor
driving behavior on Interstates that pass through Virginia to make travel in our
Commonwealth safe and enjoyable for motorists. 					
In 2013, there were three Operation Air, Land and Speed Enforcement Phases
conducted. During each of the operations, there were no fatal crashes on the
targeted interstate highways where enforcement was increased. Virginia 	has
experienced only four fatal crashes on involved interstates since the program’s
inception.

	Click-it-or-Ticket 											
	Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the 	
	primary functions of this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen a 	
	steady average increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in 	
	1997, to 79.7 % recorded in 2013. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness, 	
	education, and enforcement to gain compliance with existing safety belt laws.

Table: 46
Increasing the use of safety belts and child safety seats have statistically shown
to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes. 	
During the May phase of Click-it-or-Ticket 	state police personnel issued 1,578
summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 400 summonses for child safety
restraint violations. 	During the entire campaign 13,679 summonses were issued
by troopers for violations of traffic laws and criminal offenses throughout the
Commonwealth. 									
Operation C.A.R.E. 									
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major
holidays of Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are
the primary purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.).
During these major holiday periods that are noted for increased highway travel,
the Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address
highway safety and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth .
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 				
During 	2013, 	each 	of 	the 	department’s 	seven 	field 	divisions 	continued
enforcement emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within
the counties in their divisions. Each division’s program focused resources on
those highways where crashes, traffic violations, and citizen complaints regarding
traffic were noted. The objectives of this initiative were to prevent crashes,
reduce violations, and address the concerns citizens identified as threats to their
safety. 											
Virginia State Fair 								
On September 27, 2013, the State Fair of Virginia welcomed visitors to “The
Meadow Event Park” in Caroline County. The State Police is fully responsible for
all safety and security duties associated with the fair, its vendors, the exhibitors,
entertainers, thousands of visitors and all traffic management in and around the
fair grounds. 										
During 	the 	eleven 	days 	of 	the 	annual 	event 	an 	estimated 	229,000 	visitors
attended the fair to partake of the art and crafts, the competitions, the displays,
and the general festivities. Playing host to one-quarter of a million visitors places
a high demand on services and available resources. During the operational hours
of the fair, troopers and supervisors responded to calls for service ranging in
nature 	from 	lost 	property, 	missing 	persons, 	medical 	emergencies, 	disabled
vehicles and suspicious activity, just to name a few. 			
Safety Division 									
As of December 31, 2013, there were 4,447 active inspection stations located
throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 15,177 licensed safety
									46 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s

Table: 47
inspectors who performed approximately 7,719,800 inspections at appointed
stations during 2013. Approximately 19% (1,580,130 vehicles) of all vehicles
submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 			
This Division investigated 1,427 inspection complaints, which resulted in 1,150
instances 	of 	disciplinary 	action 	against 	271 	stations 	for 	various 	classes 	of
offenses and the suspension of 69 inspection stations. These statistics include
administrative errors made by inspection stations, and the majority of errors/
complaints were corrected by counseling sessions. 					
Disciplinary action was also taken against 363 safety inspectors, resulting in 206
suspensions. 										
Safety Division personnel also conducted 637 business security checks. 		
Motor Carrier Safety 								
Motor 	Carrier 	Safety 	teams 	ensure 	that 	trucks 	and 	buses 	meet 	all 	safety
requirements when operating on Virginia highways. Troopers assigned to the
Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other
interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations.
They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training academies. 		
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 27 hazardous material spills or incidents
in 	2013, 	and 	conducted 	119 	post-crash 		investigations 	of 	heavy 	commercial
vehicles involved in accidents. 								
Data indicates that during 2013, troopers conducted 31,934 in-depth inspections
on heavy commercial vehicles and 9,308 of these, or 29%, were placed out of
service 	for 	violations 	of 	regulations 		governing 	safety 	equipment 	and
transportation of hazardous materials. 							
Field Support 									
The Safety Division’s sworn employees provided support for local field divisions
during all major C.A.R.E. holidays. Also during 2013, Safety Division troopers had
3,537 arrests/summonses issued, investigated 17 motor vehicle crashes, assisted
local law enforcement agencies with the investigation of 114 motor vehicle
crashes, and assisted 2,062 disabled motorists. 						
Aviation Unit 									
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the
administration 	and coordination 	of the department’s aviation resources. The
Unit’s primary mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement
and medical evacuation. During its 29 year existence, the Aviation Unit has
recorded 106,172 flight hours responding to 77,740 flight requests. 		
								47 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 48 of 53”
Table: 48
The unit 	utilizes three bases located in the following Virginia localities: 			
	• 	Richmond 											
	• 	Abingdon 												
	• 	Lynchburg 											
Aircraft 													
The unit operates six helicopters, three airplanes across Virginia. 				
	• 	3 Cessna 182 airplanes 									
	• 	4 Bell 407 helicopters 									
	• 	2 American Eurocopter EC145 helicopters 						
The EC145’s are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 			
Medical Evacuation 											
The Department operates two helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve
Central 	and 	Southwest 	Virginia. 	These 	programs 	provide 	rapid 	response,
advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients to
a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the
citizens residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on
April 	1, 	1984, 	and 	responds 	to 	calls 	for 	assistance 	in 	a 	60-mile 	radius 	of
Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1, 1987, and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-
Flight III began operations on September 1, 2000, and responds to calls for
assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and
in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. 	Effective April 30, 2010, the Med-Flight III
program closed, it is now used only for law enforcement operations. In 2013, all
3 programs responded to a total of 2,418 requests with 781 patients transported.
The 	total 	number 	of 	flights 	for 	all 	three 	programs 	from 	April 	1, 	1984 	to
December 	31, 	2013, 	was 	36,157 	responses 	to 	calls 	with 	19,545 	patients
transported as a result of these calls. 									
Search and Rescue 											
During 2013, the Aviation Unit responded to 134 requests for searches for
escapees, missing persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward
Looking Infra-Red system on four helicopters and a 30 million-candlepower
searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has been successful in locating
fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. 	During this period the Unit also
recovered 1 missing aircraft. 										
Surveillance 												
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2013, the Unit
was requested 5 times for drug or narcotic surveillance, 48 times for other
criminal matters and 14 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 880 marijuana plants
were located at a value of $926,000.00.

Other Duties 												
The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any Federal, State, or municipal
agency whereby the solution of a police problem or mission may be obtained.
During 2013, the Unit provided aerial support to 26 requests from agencies
external to the Department of State Police. These flights included photographing
crime scenes, providing support for presidential motorcades, participating in
multi-agency task force efforts, and demonstrations of the capabilities of the
Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, the
Aviation Unit flew 2,528 hours responding to 2,418 flight requests. 			
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 							
The Department has primary responsibility for commercial vehicle enforcement
to include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize
the highways of the Commonwealth. During 2013, approximately 17 million
commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for
inspection. 	Through 	the 	inspection 	of 	these 	vehicles 	and 	through 	other
enforcement initiatives, commercial vehicles received 36,404 summonses and
made 14 criminal arrests. This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway
safety 	program 	through 	the 	protection 	of 	roadways 	from 	overweight 	and
oversized 		vehicles; 	through 	assurances 		that 	commercial 	vehicles 	are
mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and through the validation of all
commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a
commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 							
Crime Prevention 									
During 	2013, 	the 	Department 	provided 	specialized 	presentations, 	security
assessments, and training to citizens of Virginia. This was accomplished through
the use of Certified Crime Prevention Specialist troopers who have received
advanced 		training 	on 	current 	crime 	prevention 	trends 	and 	techniques.
Participating 	troopers 	receive 	continual 	training 	to 	enhance 	their 	ability 	in
protecting governmental, business, and residential security through the "Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model and other mitigation
based 	methodologies. 	Additional 	training 		is 	focused 	on 	personal 	safety,
workplace violence prevention and personal information associated crimes. All
training 	is 	part 	of 	an 	intensified 	crime 	prevention 	curriculum 	that 	enabled
troopers to achieve certification or remain certified through the Department of
Criminal Justice Services as Crime Prevention Specialist. 				
In 2013, approximately 152,008 citizens of Virginia and visitors were contacted
through 3,187 various crime prevention and safety programs. These programs
allowed distribution of nearly 23,914 informational handouts and brochures.
Crime Prevention troopers conducted 307 crime prevention programs and 827
										49 | F a c t s 	a n d 	F i g u r e s
