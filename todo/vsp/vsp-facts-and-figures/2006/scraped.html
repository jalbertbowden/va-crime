Communications Division 										
The Communications Division is responsible for the proper installation, operation, 		
and maintenance of telephone, land mobile radio, and microwave radios assigned to 	
the Communications Division. 										
Under the command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates 	
and maintains land mobile radios, vehicle computers, microwave radios and private telephone
networks. 	The system will include 94 microwave radio sites, 48 of which also have land mobile
radio transmitters. 	This responsibility includes compliance with requirements of the Federal 	
Communications Commission (FCC), with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the 	
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 									
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 14 teams. 	The teams are responsible for: 	
	• 	Maintaining mobile radios; 										
	• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios; 									
	• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals;

with surrounding agencies. 	The STARS project now being implemented has provided a
private data network with limited geographical coverage currently to which units can operate
mobile computer terminals through the radio. 	Mobile data use has now been expanded to the
I-81 corridor and other secondary routes parallel to the interstate due to the increased wireless
coverage provided by the 1X RTT commercial technology.
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with new
copper and fiber optic service. 	Telephone system upgrades continue as needed at area
offices and division headquarters statewide. 		
In addition to mission-critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates and
supports wireless communications equipment and services from public networks.
These services make Department personnel more accessible and keep them better informed
regarding routine and administrative activities. 	The number of wireless telephones approved
and in use has doubled in the past year, and now approaches 1,000 units.
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for special
events as they occur. 	It includes: 		
1. 	Communications to support security for visiting dignitaries
2. 	Communications to support routine events where large groups of spectators
	gather over short periods of time. 		
All field division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by the Division of
Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning forks. The present
inventory of active radars is approximately 1,500 units. 	The majority of Department radars are
newer Golden Eagle units. 			
The Division provides statewide telephone and local area network wiring requirements for the
Department, as well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of
equipment are being maintained for six additional agencies. The Division also continues to
maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most of the state’s public safety
agencies. 	The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN) activities to improve
interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area.
Criminal Justice Information Services Division
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all
files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction, and
archiving of records in accordance with the State Police Records Retention Schedule.
In 2006, the Division processed and responded to 2,691 subpoenas and 13
Freedom of Information Act requests.

Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 					
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 297,174 investigative
reports in 2006. 											
Non-Criminal Justice Program (NCJ) 							
The Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 89,763 fingerprint based searches and
277,446 name search requests for 2006. 	On February 8, 1996, the Non Criminal Justice
Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant growth and demand for criminal history
record requests. 	The NCJI can be accessed through the Department’s website. 		This interface
eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process a high volume of “paper
record name-search” requests. 									
In 2006, CCRE staff processed 110,118 or 39% paper inquiries and 167,328 or 61% electronic
name transmissions received from participants with an average response time of 72 hours or
less. 	Of the total paper record name search requests, 61,242 inquiries were submitted on the
bar-coded criminal history request forms and the remaining 48,876 were submitted on the non
bar-coded forms. This method of automation has tremendously enhanced customer service.
Mental Health File 									
These 	records 	are 	maintained 	for 	the 	purpose 	of 	denying 	individuals 	on 	file 	the
ability 	to 	purchase 	a 	firearm(s). 	Official 	notifications 	of 	individuals 	in 	these
categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual
being 	incompetent, 	involuntarily 	committed 	or 	mentally 	incapacitated. 	As 	of
December 31, 2006, there were 7,375 mental health records added, bringing the
total records on file to 78,162. 									
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 			
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for employment-
licensure purposes grew sharply. 									
9 	The SOR experienced a 13.4% increase. 						
9 	In 2006, there were 187,184 searches. 							
9 	A jump of 22,103 searches compared to 2005 					
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by providing
personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of certain sex crimes.
Photographs of offenders are available and violent offender registrations are maintained on the
Internet. 											
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 15,676 fingerprint-based registrations received
since July 1, 1997. 										
9 	Fingerprint registrations grew 27 % from 2005 to 2006. 				
SOR also verifies the addresses of sex offenders. During 2006, troopers confirmed the
addresses of 23,607 sex offenders which is an increase of 927 from the previous year.
						5 						
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 52”
Table: 9
The office also initiates criminal investigations to the field divisions. 			
9 	In 2006, the number doubled to 4,690 criminal investigations. 			
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 			
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts, and 124 Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 			
In 2006, an estimated 431,962 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to submit 	
the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions transmitted, an 	
estimated 16% were rejected. 	In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was
implemented. 	Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically 		
generated for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 	For 2006, notifications for 30,945 individual 	
charges were generated. 	The majority of notifications (89%) were generated because the court
did/could not include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data. 	The 		
remaining notifications (11%) were generated when the court transmitted the Document Control
Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file. 			
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 			
As of December 31, 2006, there were 205,130 offenders on file with commitments received 	
from the Virginia Department of Corrections, which accounts for 11.2% of the offenders on file.
The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status Information 	
on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information Interface improved the criminal history
information by providing up-to-date correctional information with minimal error. 			
The Microfilm Section 								
This section archived 647,842 documents during 2006. 					
Photographic Laboratory 							
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for photographs, digital
images, 	and 	court 	enlargements. 	Additionally, 	there 	were 	128,951 	photographic 	prints, 	a
decrease of 0.8%, developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and prosecution of
motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases in 2006. 	The lab also processed 160 compact discs
(CD’s) due to digital camera use. 							
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 			
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and partial latent 	
fingerprints recovered from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are located 	
at State Police Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state and local 	
agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their respective agencies. 	
The newly acquired Global Transaction Controller receives Live Scan transmissions and 	
provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS systems for searching and 	
updates. 	The installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive System has enhanced our ability
in the storage and retrieval of fingerprint records. 	Currently, there were 952,587 Virginia SID 	
folders created in the Electronic Archive System. 						
				6 						
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 10 of 52”
Table: 10
Currently, there are 1,740,289 ten-print fingerprint records on file and 91,224 unsolved latent
fingerprints in the database; also, the Slap database has 352,355 images. 	In 2006, there
were 2,825 suspects identified as a result of successful latent print searches on the AFIS
system. 	We no longer track latent hits. 						
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest and 	
fingerprint information to the State Police and the FBI, which has enhanced the agencies
ability to detect aliases and outstanding warrants on arrestees prior to their release. 	
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 					
Currently, there are 237 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 318 Live Scan units. 	In addition,
there are 107 civilian applicant Live Scan sites utilizing 159 Live Scan Units. 	A total of 34
criminal Live Scan sites are submitting criminal justice and concealed weapon applicant
information via Live Scan. 	The following is a brief comparison of statistics. 			
The following percentages reflect the increase or decrease in 2006. 			
CATEGORY 					% of CHANGE 				
1. Arrest records processed 		+1.08% 				
2. Arrest records via Live Scan 		+1.23%

During 	2006, 	the 	fingerprint 	section 	processed 	270,904 	criminal 	arrests 	and 	156,501
applicants. 										
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 				
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based
on the results of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2006, 224,149
firearm transactions were conducted, which is a 41⁄2% increase in transactions conducted
during 2005. 	Of these, 2,380 were denied based on the result of a criminal history record
information check. During 2006, 167 wanted persons were identified, which resulted in the
arrest of 55 individuals in Virginia, and the arrest of 15 nonresidents who were attempting to
purchase rifles or shotguns in Virginia while named in an outstanding warrant from another
state. 	In 2006, the State Police requested 970 criminal investigations related to the illegal sale
or attempt to purchase firearms, of which 652 (68%) resulted in closed arrests.

Table: 11
VCheck 		
On August 1, 2006, the Department of State Police introduced Virginia’s Internet Instant
Background Check program (VCheck) to all firearms dealers registered with the VFTP.
VCheck provides Virginia firearms dealers with easy Internet access to the State Police’s
firearms transaction system. Approval numbers are generated in instant clearances, while
transactions that require review or research are routed to the Firearms Transaction Center for
processing. 	During the first five months of implementation of VCheck, approximately 50% of
the total transactions, statewide, were processed via the Internet. 	As online users increase,
staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and verification processes.
Additional employee time devoted to these other processes provide more efficient overall
services to the firearm dealers and firearm purchasers. 	
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun dealer
to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification number for qualified
employees. 		
As of December 31, 2006, the State Police issued 7,432 seller identification numbers.
Concealed Handgun Permits 		
Since July 1, 1995, 314,456 concealed handgun permits were issued as authorized by Section
18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 25,287 were issued in 2006 (13% increase) by Virginia Circuit
Courts. During 2006, 418 nonresident concealed handgun permits were issued by the State
Police. 		
Pursuant to statute, the State Police enters the permit holder’s name and description in the
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) so that the permit's existence and current status
will be made known to law-enforcement personnel accessing the Network for investigative
purposes. 		
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 		
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident
Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the
state on 46 different crime offenses. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hardcopy
reports. 	Data is submitted either by diskette or via the Internet. 	The diskettes are scanned,
copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	The Internet files are submitted through the IBR
website. 	This is a secure system to which only contributing agencies have access. 	Each day
the submitted files are run through the edit process. This procedure generates an error report
so that agencies may correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository
database. 	A monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated and emailed to the FBI for inclusion in
their annual publication, Crime in the United States. 	
During 2006, the UCR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with IBR training issues,
interpretation of error reports, and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting procedures,
as well as assisted computer software vendors with reporting issues. 	There are 18 private IBR
certified vendors with software that transforms agency crime data into an approved IBR format.
In addition, several large agencies have built their own in-house software systems. 	Monthly
	8 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 12 of 52”
Table: 12
and quarterly reports are now posted on the IBR Web site rather than having to be mailed to
each contributing agency. 	The UCR office responded daily to multiple requests for crime
statistics from state agencies, government officials, students, media, and the general public.
Statistical crime data was published in the CJIS Newsletter, the annual report, Crime in 	
Virginia, and distributed to contributing agencies. 	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges, 	
legislators, and other state agencies also received this information. In 2004, the annual report
was published for the first time on a CD rather than hardcopy. 	The 2006 annual report will be
available to the public on a CD for a nominal fee or directly accessed through the State Police
Web site free of charge. This report contains reported Group A offenses by each contributing
agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	The
data is used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and legislative 	
implementation. 			
The IBR Web site went into production in 2002. 	Currently there are 264 agencies that have the
ability to submit their monthly data through the Internet. 	This website provides law enforcement
agencies with the convenience of on-line monthly data submission, receiving timely error
notifications, monthly and year-to-date statistical reports, performing searches and ad hoc
reporting, viewing manuals, bulletins, and posting inquiries in the FAQ section. 	
During 2006, there were ten law enforcement officers in Virginia who died while performing
their duties. 	The 2006 offenses and arrest data will not be available until approximately the
middle of April. 	Through IBR Grant funding, the front-end of the IBR Web site has been
changed to allow agencies to submit monthly files for editing so they may correct rejected
incidents before sending data to Virginia’s IBR central repository. 	Reformatting of IBR manuals
and development of online training modules are currently under development. The Department
will seek additional funding to complete additional phases of the improvement project. 	
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime 	
Information Center (NCIC) 			
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 703 member agencies with 8,556 terminals, an increase of
604 terminals, or 9% over the number of terminals in 2006. 	Of these terminals, there were
3,076 non-mobile terminals (a 9% increase over 2005), and 5,484 terminals are mobile, (an
increase of 9% from 2006). 	In 2005, VCIN processed approximately 306,000,000 transactions
(an increase of 9% of the 2006 totals) between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state
computer databases. This system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately
three seconds. 			
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which is
critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information relating
to wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia
information relating to 49,146 wanted persons (a 10% percent decrease as compared to 2006),
805 missing persons, and 12,677 stolen vehicles.

Information Technology and Planning Division 	
Information Technology 		
The Information Technology Division operates one of the largest computer centers in state
government. 	Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment and
software provided by vendors such as Fujitsu Computer Systems, NEC Solutions, UNISYS
Corporation, IBM and Sun Micro Systems and Dell Systems. The Division operates two
separate computer rooms 24 hours a day, seven days per week. 	
Automated Fingerprint Processing 	
In 2006, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 318 systems in 237 local law enforcement
and civil applicant agencies. 	More than 238,000 arrest fingerprints were electronically
transmitted to State Police in 2006 from local law enforcement agencies. 	This represents 90%
of the arrest volume in Virginia. 	Approximately 90% of the arrests received electronically at
State Police were processed without human intervention. 	
In 2006, almost 160,000 applicant prints were processed through the automated applicant
system, which reduces the turnaround time from months to days. Sixty percent of these
applicant requests were initiated at Live Scan devices and were processed with minimal
human intervention. 		
Virtual Private Network (VPN) 		
In 2002, the Telecommunications Engineering Section began replacing the Department’s
internal and external dedicated circuit networks with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This
type of network connection uses the Internet for agencies connecting to State Police offices
throughout the State. 	This networking configuration is cost efficient as multiple 	
communications links to an agency can now be combined to one link. 	In 2006, the VPN
network continued to expand, and the bandwidth at many sites were increased in preparation
for the data requirements needed as new web based applications are implemented. 	The VPN
network supports the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN), the Live Scan Fingerprint
System, the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), and the Tactical Intelligence
Processing System (TIPS). 		
Network Infrastructure 		
In 2006, network consolidation to the new Combined State Police Headquarters was complete.
This not only involved expansion of the State Police campus network, but included the
implementation of the highly secured Virginia Fusion Center network, designed to support the
f us ion of 	res our c es f rom loc al, s tat e, and f eder al agen c ies and pr i v at e indus t r ies t o f ac ilit at e
inf or m at ion c ollec t ion, analy s is , and s har ing in or der t o pr ev ent t er ror is t at t acks . 	The c am pus
net wor k was als o ext e nded t o s uppor t t he Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS)
Network Operations Center designed to achieve interoperable communications among our
local and statewide first responders. 	
In 2006, the Virginia State Police core and divisional network was upgraded to eliminate single
points of failure. 	Dual hardware and data links were implemented to provide the speed,
stability and redundancy required in the goal to achieve 99.9% network availability.

The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 			
The VCIN system processed over 325 million transactions in 2006, which is an increase of 45
million compared to 2005. 	In addition, the Virginia Department of Corrections successfully
converted 100 terminals to the OpenFoxTM Messenger product for VCIN access. 	OpenFoxTM
Messenger allows for application level encryption and the transfer of images. 	
Disaster Recovery Project 						
A new Fujitsu 900 system was installed at our disaster recovery site for fail over. 	The Fujitsu
900 system completely replaces the Sun V880 system and provides for recovery to the
disaster site in case the State Police Administrative Headquarters site is not available for an
extended period. 	Fujitsu E3000 disk storage was also added to address current and future
disk storage capacity. 								
Virginia Amber Alert System 						
A new system was developed in March 2006 to automate the entry and notification process for
Virginia’s Amber Alert system. The system is designed to provide a comprehensive and rapid
broadcast of information that will lead to the safe recovery of a child and capture of the
abductor. Local law enforcement agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request
form, enter the information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 	
As soon as the Amber Alert request is accepted by Virginia State Police, the notifications are
automatically sent to all law enforcement agencies, local broadcasters, Virginia Department of
Transportation and the Virginia Amber Alert website. The system has significantly reduced the
time required to get this information out to the public. 				
The major components of Virginia’s Amber Alert System include: 			
1. 	Emergency Alert System 					
2. 	Virginia Criminal Information Network 					
3. 	Virginia 	Department 	of 	Transportation 	Message 	Boards 	and 	Highway 	Alert
	Radios and other VDOT Communication Systems 				
4. 	Lost Child Alert Technology Resource System 				
5. 	The Virginia Missing Children Clearinghouse 				
The secondary components of Virginia’s Amber Alert System include: 		
	9 	Public Utilities’ Communications Systems 				
	9 	Notification of a Regional Plan Infrastructure. 			
Firearms System Vcheck (Virginia’s Instant Background Check) 		
In July 2006, the new Vcheck system was implemented to allow firearms dealers access to an
“instant background check system” through a secure internet connection. 	At that time, there
were approximately 60 active “direct access” dealers who had VCIN terminals as the only
method to enter gun buyer information and get a direct response without having to make a call
to the Firearms Transaction Center call center. 	Since implementing Vcheck, 346 firearms
dealers have registered with the VCheck program. 	That number is expected to exceed 400 by
late Spring 2007 when all Walmart stores in Virginia participating in firearms sales will register.
					11 				
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 15 of 52”
Table: 15
Over half of the statewide volume of firearms transactions is being processed using the
internet VCheck system. 	Several dealers use VCheck at gun show events, which has greatly
reduced the number of transactions called in to the Firearms Transaction Center during those
events. 		
The busiest season for the Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) is the last three
months of the year; the hunting and holiday season. 	During this peak period, the VFTP has
historically required an average of 150 additional work hours each week, compensated by
overtime pay. 	In addition to the highest volume of transactions, which was 4% higher than last
year, the VFTP also experienced a 13% reduction of employee work hours per week due to
vacant positions during this year’s busy season. As a direct result of VCheck activity placing
less demand on the 800-telephone, and subsequent operator assistance, a 20% reduction in
overall overtime work hours was realized during this busy season. 	
Use of VCheck has greatly improved the efficiency by which dealers can process transactions
and has produced a higher level of customer satisfaction. 	Comments continue to be received
by the FTC from users expressing enthusiasm about the program. 	An on-line survey has been
implemented to further canvas registered users for suggestions or comments and will be sent
out through mass email. 		
Sex Offender Registry (SOR) 		
A new Sex Offender Registry was implemented May 2006 incorporating numerous 	
enhancements and legislative mandates. 		
The new registry has greatly improved the public’s access and use of this information. 	Since
July 1, 2006, all offenders, including non-violent, can be accessed through the website. In
addition, each individual sex offender’s home and work addresses are geocoded and the map
is viewable from each sex offender’s individual information page. 	The public is able to enter
their home address and the system will provide a map of all sex offenders within an 	
approximate five mile radius of their address. The public can also generate a map of any city
or county in the Commonwealth of Virginia that pinpoints the sex offenders in that community.
Another enhancement is the link to the Wanted Persons files that allows the public to easily
and quickly identify sex offenders who are wanted. 	
In addition to the new website, the core SOR application was migrated to newer technology
providing a much more user friendly and capable system than the previous system. 	The new
system allows VSP users to generate reports on an as needed basis instead of having to make
requests to the Information Technology & Planning Production Control staff and waiting for
nightly batch processing. 	The system also sends registry data to NCIC in a real-time 	
environment instead of the previous nightly batch process. 	In addition, the system was
designed to allow for user configurability to reduce the need for support from the Information
Technology and Planning staff. 	The database was moved to a modern relational database
that has made ad-hoc reporting possible. 	The move to a relational database also allowed for a
real-time interface with the Wanted Persons files to flag Sex Offender records that have
outstanding warrants.

Sex Offender Verification (SOV) 							
The Sex Offender Verification system was implemented June 2006. 	SOV is a web based
system used by the Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections for tracking and
assuring that the home, work and school addresses of sex offenders are physically verified
within the time tables set forth by General Assembly Legislation effective July 1, 2006. The
SOV system is integrated with the SOR system to assure any change in status, home, work
and school addresses are reflected. 							
Internal Affairs System 									
A new Internal Affairs system was implemented November 2006. Using this system, the
Professional Standards Unit can quickly and efficiently enter, search and analyze data through
built in reporting tools. 	It categorizes this information and allows for easy retrieval by this unit,
and executive management. 								
It also has an early warning/early intervention process to help reduce the agency’s
risk and improve employee performance. 	A web based component to this system
will 	be 	implemented 	in 	May 	2007 	to 	allow 	for 	secure 	access 	by 	authorized
management personnel remotely. 							
Planning and Research 								
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all divisions and
units of the department and is responsible for: 					
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies
• 	Updating staffing formulas 								
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs
• 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies 			
• 	Developing and monitoring the department’s performance measures 	
• 	Providing support in the development of grant applications and budgetary submissions
• 	Conducting legislative studies mandated by the General Assembly; 	
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan 			
• 	Developing and maintaining the Department’s Continuity of Operations Plan
• 	Preparing the annual Use of Force Report 					
• 	Conducting the annual Citizen Survey 						
During 2006, the Planning and Research Section administered 49 grants that provided
approximately $44 million in funding for agency projects. 			
Accreditation 											
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement
services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally
accepted standards. 	Accreditation requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of the
Department’s organization, operations, and administration. 			
							13

Table: 17
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the
nation to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies
(CALEA), Inc. In 1991, 1996, 2001, and again in 2005, the Department achieved 	
reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review by CALEA assessors of the agency’s
policies, procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for
all accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic
updating of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law
enforcement standards. 	In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven agencies
awarded a Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully maintaining accredited
status for over 15 years. 			
Personnel Division 			
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management,
with continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the Department’s
work force. 			
Recruitment Unit 			
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in December 2006 to include a first sergeant,
sergeant/recruiter six full time recruiters and one part-time secretary. 	Refocusing recruitment
efforts has enabled the Department to concentrate on recruiting and hiring the most qualified,
diverse workforce to meet the demand of the future of policing in our global communities.
Specific recruitment strategies were designed and implemented to aid in accomplishing the
goals of the unit. The Recruitment Unit recruiters gave a combined 703 programs at selected
sites in 2006 to generate a diverse and qualified applicant pool. 	The following are current
strategies: 			
♦ 	Recruitment “Lunch Boxes” 		
These programs are directed at Virginia’s university, college, and community colleges during
the spring and fall semesters. 	Recruiters set up in student unions, dining halls, etc. to
introduce students to career opportunities within the Department. 	These programs also foster
a positive image between the student citizens and policing. 	Recruiters conduct three programs
per month in their division. 		
♦ 	Civic/Women/Minority Organizations 	
Organizations were identified in each of the Department’s seven field divisions. 	Each recruiter
is required to present three of these programs with one of the three programs directed at
women’s recruitment. 			
♦ 	Military Recruitment 		
Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning military personnel. 	Virginia has
the most military facilities of any state in the nation and the military offers a very diverse
candidate pool. 			
		14 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 18 of 52”
Table: 18
♦ 	Student Athlete Recruitment 		
There is a minimum of two programs per month, during active semesters, at identified college
and/or university athlete populations via athletic unions and organizations. 	In addition, 	
recruiters have identified health clubs and are actively recruiting personnel who attend these
facilities. 	One of the two programs per month must be focused on women’s recruitment. 	
♦ 	Career Fairs 			
Career fairs are conducted at various locations throughout the state to included contiguous 	
jurisdictions. 	Career fairs are attended on a selective basis. 		
♦ 	Career Sessions 			
Career Sessions have been scheduled quarterly throughout the state to present to the public
members of the Department and information for those interested in joining. 	The focus of these
events is on the recruitment of minorities and women. 		
Employment Section 			
The Department hired 95 trooper trainees for the 111th Basic Session that began on July 10,
2006, and 59 trooper trainees for the 112th Basic Session that began on August 25, 2006. 	
These troopers’ applications were processed from a pool of 1,623 applications received. 	The
applicants for these schools took the Law Enforcement Services, Inc., a battery of written tests
and on-line personal history questionnaire. 		
The Employment Section advertised 358 civilian positions (222 full-time and 136 wage) 	
throughout 2006. 	This is a 7.9% decrease in the 389 positions advertised in 2005. 	The total
number of applicants who applied in 2006 was 3,965. 	This is a 2.2% decrease in the 4,053 	
applications received during 2005. 		
The Employment Section processed 27 grievances during 2006, an increase of three from 	
2005. 	There were 70 written notices processed, an increase of 12.9% from the 62 written 	
notices processed in 2005. 	Seven equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints were filed
in 2006 (6 federal and 1 state), compared to 3 filed in 2005. 		
During 2006, 78 volunteers gave 8,211 hours of their time in locations throughout the state. 	In
April, a volunteer recognition event was held to thank our devoted volunteers for their service
to the Department in 2005. 	Speakers at the event were Colonel Flaherty and Mr. Kenneth 	
Wilber, volunteer in BCI/SSD. 		
Effective September 15, 2006, the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Employment 	
Commission (VEC) joined in a partnership to provide clerical/computer testing to potential 	
applicants.

The Employment Unit continues to provide training to Department supervisors and employees
on Workplace Harassment, Workplace Violence, and Grievance procedures. 	All new
employees receive a comprehensive orientation, which provides a broad overview of the
operation of the Virginia State Police, the procedures, and policies that guide the agency
including performance expectations, compensation, and benefits. 	Education and training to all
employees continues to prove very successful. 	
There were no complaints of workplace harassment or workplace violence in 2006. 	
Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section (CCTR) 	
During the 2006 year, the CCTR section processed 247 new employees placing them on
payroll, processed 275 promotions, 351 transfers, 124 separations, 50 retirements, two deaths
in service, and a large number of address and name changes. 	During this period, the section
also received and processed a large number of employment history and verification requests,
32 records subpoenas, 27 requests for purchase of individual firearms, several Freedom of
Information Act inquiries and several legal inquiries. 	
The CCTR section also received, audited and processed three Classification requests from the
Superintendent’s Office, 30 from BASS (new Trooper positions), 39 from BCI, 15 from BFO, 23
from CJIS, 30 from Property and Finance, 8 from Information Technology and Planning, two
from Personnel, three from Communications and STARS, and four from Training. 	This section
also received and processed two in-band adjustments from BCI, and one from BFO. 	An
additional 402 in-band adjustments were processed as the result of a study of civilian pay
inequity. 		
In addition, this section established or reallocated 15 wage positions and responded to nine
salary surveys. 	CCTR also maintained all weight control records on all sworn personnel,
central Personnel Records, all Background Records, all Position files and selected medical
files for the Department. 	Additionally, this section reviewed and processed all VEC inquiries,
processed employees entering and returning from military service, and analyzed and returned
explanations for audit exceptions reports for all pay transactions. 	
This section reviewed and processed 2,589 performance evaluations for 2006, which included
893 rated as extraordinary contributor, 999 major contributor, 694 contributors, no marginal
contributors and three below contributor. 	In this period, 15 appeals were received, 7 ratings
were increased and 8 were sustained. 	Wage employees were also rated in this same period
and their position records were updated for the next cycle. 	
Property and Finance Division 		
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial and property
management functions. 	It is responsible for preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the
Department's annual operating budget, which was in excess of $238,291,626 for fiscal year
2006. 		
	16 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 20 of 52”
Table: 20
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of property management and
logistical functions. 	It was responsible for the procurement, warehousing, and distribution of
more than $22,872,400 in supplies and equipment in 2006. 	The Property and Logistics
Division is also responsible for the management and maintenance of 115 buildings and
grounds across the state. 			
During calendar year 2006, an existing office building in Buchanan County (Vansant) was
acquired and is now the new Vansant State Police Area Office. 	A contract was issued and
construction has begun on the new Zone II Master Site for STARS at the Division VI 	
Headquarters (Salem). 	An architectural/engineering contract was issued and design has
begun on the renovation of the original State Police Administrative Headquarters building.
Construction was also completed on the renovation of the STARS Training Facility. 	
The Division oversees the mailroom and printing sections, which processed 426,221 pieces of
mail during 2006, and printed 5,145,814 copies. 	It also manages the garage, which is
responsible for equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately 2,300 vehicles. 	
The Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military Property Program, which
allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost, military property and 	
equipment that is in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is 	
appointed by the Governor as the point of contact, and provides a state coordinator. 	The
program serves over 250 Virginia law enforcement agencies and in 2006 the program
distributed goods valued over $670,000 dollars. 			
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day
operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122
Program.” 	This program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law
enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic activities through the federal procurement
channels at substantial savings. 	During 2006, over $1,312,143 was purchased through this
program, saving the Department $829,434. 			
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 		
The Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program was originally conceived in the mid-
1990s to be an upgrade to the Virginia State Police's antiquated 1977 land mobile radio
system. 	As planning progressed, both technological advances and direction from state
government led the program to the present concept of a shared system composed of the 21
state agencies that use two-way radio communication as a regular part of their operations.
On July 13, 2005, Colonel W. Steven Flaherty, State Police Superintendent, and Mr. Mark
Moon, Vice President and General Manager of Motorola, signed a $329 million contract
between Motorola and the Commonwealth of Virginia for the design, construction, and
implementation of STARS. 	A ceremonial contract signing was held on July 16, 2005, in
conjunction with a press conference. 	The implementation of STARS is now underway.
To support the large increase of user agencies and radios, the microwave backbone of the
system is undergoing a complete renovation. 	The 87 existing tower sites will grow to 94 sites
	17 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 21 of 52”
Table: 21
and the network is now designed to have alternate paths, or loops, to provide continuously
high reliability in the event of path outage. 		
There are 48 of these tower sites that will be used for the actual two-way communications with
the user's mobile and portable radios. From these sites, the Commonwealth personnel will
receive quality, statewide, mobile radio coverage. STARS will be one of the first geographically
statewide systems to employ digital trunked technology in the VHF 150 MHz band.
Virginia will be one of the first states to employ an Integrated Voice and Data (IV&D) land
mobile radio architecture, which uses the same mobile radio for both voice and law
enforcement computer communications. 	Virginia will, therefore, have statewide mobile data
coverage. Integrating the voice and data networks saves the Commonwealth the expense of a
separate data infrastructure. The IV&D infrastructure will also provide Over-the-Air Re-Keying
(OTAR) of the radio encryption, a recent technological innovation. 	This allows the encryption
codes resident in the vehicle’s equipment to be managed remotely.
The digital trunking technology allows different functional groupings of people to communicate
privately within their own organizational elements, known as “talk-groups,” even while other
groups are communicating among themselves. 	As the members move throughout Virginia, the
system will automatically track them so they will retain communications statewide.
The digital trunking technology will also be carried a step further for the agencies that use
portable radios while away from their vehicles. STARS will include a Digital-Vehicular-
Repeater-System (DVRS), which will translate the VHF signal used between the tower and
vehicle, into a 700 MHz signal used for vehicle-to-portable communications.
STARS is complete in the Richmond area, which includes four cities and 21 counties. In
Tidewater, the Communications Center has been renovated with eight new dispatch consoles.
Testing of the tower sites began March 5, 2007 with anticipated completion of the Tidewater
area by September 2007. 		
Infrastructure work is ongoing in Culpeper, Northern Virginia, Salem, Wytheville, and
Appomattox. 	Construction of the Zone 2 Control Center is underway in Salem, with completion
anticipated for September 2007. 		
The STARS Project is scheduled to be implemented over a six-year period.

STARS, Motorola, and CTA Communications anticipate statewide implementation will be
completed prior to September 2009. 				
A single interface link will be provided to each of the counties and independent cities to bring
interoperability at no cost to the jurisdiction. In a wide scale emergency, localities may be
connected to each other in this manner, thus providing regional intercommunications. 	A $1.5
million dollar grant was received to implement an interoperability solution named COMLINC
within 14 counties in Central Virginia. 	COMLINC is now operational in those 14 counties.
Grant funding is being sought to implement COMLINC statewide. 	If successful this will replace
the single interface link to each city and county. 			
The implementation of each of these exciting and cutting-edge technologies into STARS will
provide the Commonwealth with critical public safety communications.

BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of
all criminal matters mandated by statute and established Department
policy through the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is
mandated to investigate any matter referred by the Governor. Additionally,
the Attorney General, Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Chiefs of Police,
Sheriffs and Grand Juries may request the Department to investigate
matters, which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also
conducts investigations of elected officials when directed by the Governor,
Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau consists of the Criminal
Intelligence Division, Support Services Division, Drug Enforcement
Section, and the General Investigation Section.
General Investigation Section (GIS)
GIS responds to all complaints referred by the Governor and other complaints that constitutes
a Class 1, 2 or 3 felony. Other requests for investigations are discretionary but major emphasis
27
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 31 of 52”
Table: 31
is placed on responding to requests from the Attorney General, Commonwealth’s Attorneys,
Grand Juries, Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth. 	
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement
agencies. Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state to
ensure that adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable time.
The GIS has 190 authorized positions, of which 149 are Special Agents assigned to conduct
investigations. The remaining 50 positions are supervisors and support personnel. During
2006, GIS conducted 4,736 investigations, of which 1,661, or 36%, resulted from requests
from other law enforcement agencies. GIS Special Agents made a total of 3,490 arrests.
Crime Scene Examination – The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the
Division of Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called upon by other State Police
employees and by local law enforcement agencies to examine and evaluate evidence at crime
scenes. 	In 2006, 279 scenes were examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, arson,
burglary, and numerous other major crimes. 		
Fugitive Apprehension – Eight Special Agents staff Fugitive Apprehension. 	There are two
Special Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension in the Richmond Field Office, and one
Special Agent at the Appomattox, Chesapeake, Culpeper, Fairfax, Salem, and Wytheville field
offices. 		
The Fugitive Apprehension mission is to affect the swift apprehension of all fugitives,
particularly in connection with violent crimes. Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension work
closely with local and federal law enforcement agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2006,
members were assigned 634 cases and made 719 arrests. 	
National White-Collar Crime Center – The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Criminal
Investigation is the Department’s representative to the National White-Collar Crime Center, a
federally-funded program with 2,188 member agencies and 193 associate member agencies
throughout the country. 	Members of the center assist with the investigation and prosecution of
various white-collar crimes.

Table: 32
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 42 trained hostage negotiators available for
hostage or barricade situations. 	During 2006, the negotiators trained 17 times with local law
enforcement and State Police tactical teams. 	They responded to 24 barricaded subject 	
situations. 			
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – This Unit consists of 9 High Technology Crimes Special
Agents. 	The Cyber Crime agents opened 399 cases in 2006, involving a variety of 	
investigations for this Department and other local and federal agencies. 	
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant, who is assigned to the Support Services Division, is the
chief arson investigator and coordinates activities between the Bureau of Criminal Investigation
and other investigative agencies throughout the state. 	
Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by localities. 	During
2006, the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in providing the following training 	
related to arson investigations and explosives related matters: 	
. 	Investigators attend a weeklong Arson Investigation School from statewide law 	
	enforcement, fire services and insurance agencies. 	
. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling bomb threats,
	bomb scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices. 	
. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and blast 	
	characteristics for law enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, 	
	conferences, and academies. 		
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically trained to
investigate arson-related matters. 	In 2006, GIS conducted 308 fire scene investigations. 	Of
these investigations, 93 were determined to be incendiary in origin, 67 were determined to be
accidental, and 148 were of an undetermined origin. 	
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 33 trained bomb technicians assigned to
the GIS. 	In 2006, there were 409 explosives-related incidents requiring the GIS to respond
and provide explosives-related expertise. 	During 2006, there were 4 actual explosive devices
rendered safe and 59 hoax and suspicious items requiring examination by bomb technicians.
Bomb technicians continue to present bomb threat presentations to school staffs throughout
the Commonwealth. 			
Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents are funded by the
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program. 	A total of eight Special Agents are assigned to
Richmond, Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake, Salem, and Fairfax divisions.
These Special Agents work closely with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the 	
National Insurance Crimes Bureau, and federal and local law enforcement agencies to 	
investigate crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other illegal
activity. 			
		29

In 2006, the eight Special Agents conducted 184 motor vehicle theft investigations, resulting in
21 arrests and the recovery of 48 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment with a
combined value of $592,701. They also received more than 438 requests for assistance from
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. 	
Auto Theft Agents coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft investigators and
insurance company special investigative units across the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These
meetings are held to discuss current automobile theft trends and coordinate enforcement
efforts among law enforcement agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide auto theft
investigation training to numerous Troopers and local law-enforcement officers at the Virginia
State Police Academy and regional academies. 	
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program is
an insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-414 of the Code of Virginia.
The Program was established in 1992 to receive and reward auto theft related tips. 	Callers
who provide information that leads to the arrest of individuals for auto theft related crimes
become eligible for cash rewards. 	On January 1, 2004 the maximum reward increased from
$10,000 to $25,000. 	Seven full $10,000 rewards were paid to callers before this increase took
effect. 	During 2005-06, a total of $59,475 was awarded to nineteen citizens who earned
H.E.A.T. rewards by helping the police. 		
The Department’s H.E.A.T. Program provides leadership to over 165 state and local police and
sheriff agencies working cooperatively to reduce auto theft throughout Virginia. 	During 2006,
the H.E.A.T. staff consisted of a first sergeant, two special agents, one trooper-agent, one
crime analyst and one support technician. 	H.E.A.T. personnel support auto theft reduction
efforts by providing training, conducting promotional events, conducting prevention/VIN
Etching events, offering grant funding, procuring specialized equipment, coordinating monthly
meetings of regional auto theft investigators, providing Department of Motor Vehicles’ 	
documentation to support prosecutions and by assembling auto theft statistical information.
Since 2003, over 394 title searches were completed for auto theft investigators in the United
States and Canada. 		
H.E.A.T. conducts two basic and one advanced auto theft investigation school for law 	
enforcement annually. 	In 2004, H.E.A.T. and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association
implemented a new 16-hour auto theft prevention school which will be offered to crime
prevention specialists and Operation HEATWave Coordinators 4 times per year. The H.E.A.T.
office also began the production of five bait cars that will be employed in high theft jurisdictions
to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 		
The H.E.A.T. Program works with Neathawk Dubuque and Packett, a private marketing
agency, to increase the public’s awareness about the problem of auto theft, auto theft 	
prevention devices and strategies, the H.E.A.T. Program, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-
HEAT) and cash rewards of up to $25,000. 	Citizens are directed to the H.E.A.T. Web Site at:
www.heatreward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The public is encouraged
to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they ever learn of any auto theft related information. 	In
	30

Table: 34
addition, H.E.A.T. promotional messages run throughout Virginia on television, radio,
billboards, newspapers and on three NASCAR race cars. 	
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted in a
momentous reduction in Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s motor vehicle theft
rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately 30%. 	Working together to protect
cars by employing the “Layered Approach to Protection” and educating the public regarding
the toll-free hotline to increase tips has proven to be an effective strategy to make Virginia a
safer place to own and operate a motor vehicle. 	
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved
establishing an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Department of State Police,
Bureau of Criminal Investigation. In 2003, the General Assembly lifted the sunset clause
making the Insurance Fraud Program a permanent unit of the Department. The purposes of
this Unit are threefold: 	
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the Department
	has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently being committed,
	and to undertake studies to determine the extent of such insurance fraud;
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state
	and local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units, and
	any other person; 	
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud that,
	in its judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations.
Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging burglaries,
fraudulently reporting theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation injuries. The IFP is
constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving claim
funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as
represented by the total amount of claimed loss that was actually received by individuals
submitting suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2006, more than $3.4 million was actually
collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud and the total amount involved in
suspicious claims that was attempted, but not collected, was $8.3 million.
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the
increased cost of goods and services. This Program is dedicated to reducing the impact of
fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of Virginia. The hotline for persons to
call in with information about suspected insurance fraud receives frequent activity. The toll-free
telephone number is: 1-877- 62FRAUD. (1-877-623-7283) 	
In 2006, 1,939 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward program has
been established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for individuals having a Sharp Eye and
reporting information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of individuals committing insurance
	31

Table: 35
fraud. IFP operates the reward program by use of the insurance fraud hotline and through
information obtained during investigations and provided by the general public. A reward
committee has been selected to make recommendations based on written policy and
procedures. Their recommendations are forwarded through channels to the Superintendent for
final approval. 	Since 2003, the Insurance Fraud Program has paid out $41, 500 in rewards to
those individuals that have a “Sharp Eye” and reported insurance fraud. 	
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of insurance
fraud to the general public, law enforcement, the insurance industry and media. 	A portion of
the Web site provides the insurance industry and the general public the capability to report
incidents of suspected insurance fraud directly to the Insurance Fraud Program on line. This
service is available through the Department’s Web site and www.stampoutfraud.com
There are currently 21 Special Agents assigned to investigate insurance fraud. 	Their primary
focus is on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section
18.2-178, obtaining money under false pretense; this section was amended by the General
Assembly in 2006. 	The amended code establishes venue for prosecuting the crime of
obtaining money by false pretense. 	This means that for crimes committed after July 1, 2006,
the person charged with obtaining money by false pretense can be tried in one of two places –
the jurisdiction in which the person lived when the crime was committed or in the jurisdiction
where the crime was actually committed. 	
During 2006, more than 1,895 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance fraud
were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and the general public.
There were 368 criminal investigations initiated by the Special Agents and 200 arrests for
insurance fraud and related offenses. 	One-hundred-fifty-one insurance fraud cases were
prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered restitution of $503,449 during 2006. 	
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 	
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws.
The Section remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to
enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional field offices also help in this effort by supporting
special operations initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 96 Special Agents
available for this purpose. 		
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support
personnel in six distinct functional areas: 	
• DES Regional Field Offices 		
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 		
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 		
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 	
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 		
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 		
	32 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 36 of 52”
Table: 36
From Jan. 1, 2006 through Dec. 31, 2006, DES field offices participated in 1,751 investigations
that yielded $16,140,294 in seized narcotics, $899,251 in seized currency, and 235 persons
arrested on 308 felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 979 persons were arrested on
1,343 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES assisted other agencies. 	Special
Agents also seized 52 vehicles and 184 weapons. 		
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DES participates in 24 state and local multi-jurisdictional
task forces, encompassing 96 local jurisdictions. 	Thirty-four State Police Special Agents and
158 local officers were assigned to state and local task forces. 		
During 2006, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 4,201 investigations that
accounted for $8,430,028 in illicit drug seizures, $319,801 in seized U.S. currency, and 2,077
persons arrested on 2,791 charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases
that resulted in 590 persons arrested on 832 charges. 	These task forces also seized 50
vehicles and 185 weapons. 			
Federal Task Forces – DES participated in 11 federal narcotics task forces during 2006.
State Police Special Agents, as well as officers from local police departments and agents from
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) participated in the federal narcotics task forces. 	The federal
joint task forces conducted 53 investigations that accounted for $3,579,870 in drug seizures
and 30 persons arrested on 46 charges. 	These task forces also assisted with 16 arrests on 22
charges and seized four weapons. 			
Marijuana Eradication Program – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the
cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for
being a major cash crop. With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with
assistance from other state and local law enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army
National Guard Reconnaissance Air Interdiction Detachment (RAID), conducted a regular
program to eradicate domestically-grown marijuana. 	The State Police and local law 	
enforcement agencies found 18,272 plants in 259 outdoor plots. There were also 1,729
marijuana plants eradicated in 49 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication operations resulted in
253 arrests. 	Seizures included 197 weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at
$1,540,726. 	Considering the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the
cash value of marijuana not reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess
of $20 million. 			
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to
facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Six Special
Agents are assigned to GIANT. 	The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 		
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and
	outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers as
	a primary goal; 			
		33 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 37 of 52”
Table: 37
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor
	suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating
	clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 	
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway;
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in
	communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and;
5. Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum extent
	possible. 		
GIANT performed 452 operations during 2006 that resulted in 441 arrests, and the seizure of
$13,592,125.00 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 86 weapons, 26 vehicles, and
$217,803.62 in U.S. currency. 		
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit
purposes continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion predates the
massive abuse of other drugs we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion
agents work with the DEA, the Department of Health Profession, and the Department of
Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies to eliminate the diversion of
prescription drugs for illicit purposes. 	
During 2006, Drug Diversion received 1,939 complaints of diversion activities throughout the
Commonwealth. 	In response to these complaints, 536 investigations were initiated and the 16
Special Agents assigned to Drug Diversion arrested a total of 397 persons on 725 charges.
Ten search warrants were executed during the past year.
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement officials about the
extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it.
This role also included educating health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists,
about the magnitude of the problem and the importance of self-policing and ensuring the
integrity of their individual health care delivery systems. 	During 2006, 12 presentations were
conducted for 662 healthcare professionals, and four presentations were conducted for 140
individuals in law enforcement. 		
Criminal Intelligence Division 	
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document, and
disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime or terrorism.
CID is currently composed of five units and one section – the Analytical Unit, Research Unit,
Field Intelligence Unit, Technical Support Unit, Computer Evidence Recovery Unit, Tactical
Intelligence Processing System (TIPS) Section, and the Virginia Fusion Center.
		34 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 38 of 52”
Table: 38
CID’s Analytical Unit operates the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), which is a
repository of intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law enforcement personnel.
VCIC’s analysts provide research and analytical support to criminal justice agencies. The
analysts assigned use multiple databases and are in daily contact with local, state, and federal
organizations in order to accomplish their mission. 		
The one agent assigned to the Research Unit accomplishes a wide variety of tasks. 	The agent
assists the other CID units with specific research tasks, field investigations including 		
surveillance, Interpol requests, officer safety issues, and the handling of fictitious identifications
for undercover personnel. 			
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect and
supply intelligence, including information on current investigations. 	The agents also routinely
use the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The unit consists of agents that
are placed in each of the Department’s seven divisions. 		
In 2006, the Technical Support Unit received 1513 requests for service. 	Of those requests 447
were in support of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each request was
directly related to ongoing criminal investigations, which were supported with the installation of
audio and video recording equipment. 	The unit continues to support significant investigations
and uses methods and technologies to assist any requesting law enforcement agency. 	The
unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement agencies, as well
as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ offices through installation and
operation of 71 closed circuit television systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	The 	
Hostage/Barricade Unit program continues to support state and local law enforcement through
the deployment of sophisticated technical equipment. The Hostage/Barricade Unit responded
to 15 Hostage/Barricade incident requests. 		
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) provides assistance to local, state and federal
law enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for computer-related
evidence, evidence recovery through forensic examination, and quarterly training classes in
computer search and seizure. 	In 2006, the CERU completed 92 investigations on 130 	
computers and 1,224 peripheral items, and 14,406 gigabytes of data. 	The CERU also handled
1,413 internet fraud complaints and provided 330 hours of instruction on computer crime.
The TIPS Section is currently working with law enforcement agencies throughout the 	
Commonwealth in order to provide them with the Tactical Intelligence Processing System that
will allow intelligence to be entered, stored, and shared with all agencies in the system. 	The
TIPS Section is also currently working with public safety agencies statewide to provide them
with the Virginia Critical Information Shared System, a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that
will allow intelligence to be posted on a six-tiered system ranging from executive decision-
makers, law enforcement, critical infrastructure companies in both the private and public sector
and the general public. 			
The Virginia Fusion Center gathers, analyzes and disseminates information and intelligence as
it relates to all criminal activity, but primarily domestic and foreign terrorism. 	In 2005, the
	35 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 39 of 52”
Table: 39
Fusion Center moved into a new location within the Virginia Combined Headquarters. 	This 	
joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Department of Emergency
Management is the first of its kind in the Commonwealth. Its primary mission is to “fuse” 	
together resources from local, state and federal agencies and private industries to facilitate 	
information collection, analysis and sharing, in order to prevent or deter a terrorist attacks. 	Its
secondary mission is to support the Virginia Emergency Operations Center by centralizing 	
information and resources to provide a coordinated and effective response in the event of an
attack or natural disaster. 			
CID is also responsible for the Terrorism Hotline, Drug Hotline, and the Domestic Terrorism
Tracking/Assessment System. 	The Terrorism Hotline has received 964 calls since its 		
inception in 2001. The Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System was established to
assess vulnerabilities and threats related to terrorism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	
Support Services Division (SSD) 		
The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004 as a result of the Department’s
reorganization of BCI. The Insurance Fraud Division, Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) and
the Drug Diversion Unit were decentralized and absorbed within SSD. However, the Special
Agents assigned to these units have continued their current investigative capacities operating
out of their respective BCI field offices. 		
The SSD is responsible for the law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns and 	
insurance industry outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) and Help
Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.). 	The Bomb, Arson Program and Drug Diversion Program also
make up the SSD as well as the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI). 	The 	
SSD provides statistical gathering, technical training and financial management support for 	
these units. 	The H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free telephone hotlines are administered
and maintained by the SSD. 	Initial notifications of suspected insurance fraud and auto theft
activities are received via the SSD hotlines, Web sites, e-mails and faxes. 	The notifications
are reviewed and distributed to the appropriate local law enforcement agencies or to the 	
Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s field offices where investigations are conducted by the 	
Department’s Special Agents on a case-by-case basis. 		
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 		
Since its establishment on July 1, 2000 by the Virginia General Assembly, the Special 		
Operations Division (SOD) has undergone a remarkable transformation. SOD’s primary 	
mission was the interdiction of narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public transportation systems
as well as in schools and businesses. 	SOD provided outstanding assistance to local police
departments from around the state requesting assistance to augment their resources by 	
effectively addressing localized drug and firearm-related problems/situations that exceeded
their existing resources. 			
Due to the events of September 11, 2001, and reorganization within the Virginia State Police,
the Special Operations Division was re-designated as the Special Operations Unit and 	
expanded its personnel, offices, and duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit
carried out the Virginia State Police Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) Homeland Security 	
	36 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 40 of 52”
Table: 40
responsibilities related to response and recovery operations. 	The seven areas within the unit
served to coordinate the response of other resources and were core members of the Statewide
Regional Response Teams. 									
On January 10, 2003, the name of the unit was changed to the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal
Interdiction Unit (CCI) with fully operational teams in each of the seven traditional State Police
Divisions. 	The area teams were comprised of a Sergeant, a Special Agent, a Trooper, and all
narcotic canine handlers within the geographical boundaries of the area. 	In addition to making
each of the teams fully operational, CCI was assigned the mission to devote resources and
efforts in performing Homeland Security responsibilities, conducting advanced criminal
interdiction investigations, and providing assistance to local law enforcement agencies in
communities were the quality of life for its citizens had been negatively impacted by criminal
activities. 	On August 10, 2003, CCI was transferred to the Bureau of Criminal Investigations
(BCI). 													
In 	November 	2005, 	the 	mission 	of 	CCI 	evolved 	to 	incorporate 	a 	new 	strategic 	initiative
developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes. 			
CCI provides assistance to local law enforcement agencies with specially-trained members in
identifying gang members and enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth related to gang
violence and illegal criminal activities. 	In 2006 CCI efforts were as follows:

Homeland Security - The CCI Homeland Security component currently consists of 46 sworn
employees (authorized 49 sworn employees) assigned to eight regional teams, prepared to
respond to a terror-related event to recover hazardous material evidence and assist other
federal, state, and local agencies. 	Currently 44 of the team members are certified Hazardous
Material Technicians trained to enter a scene that may be contaminated with biological,
chemical, or radiological substances. 	Each team is equipped with detection and monitoring
equipment to identify and classify hazardous substances employed during a terror attack and
collect samples for the purposes of determining treatment for persons exposed, and obtaining
evidence for prosecution. 	Fifteen of the team members have completed Environmental Crimes
Investigation training provided by the Virginia Department of Fire Programs. 		
Additional training is ongoing to further prepare the teams to deal with terrorist-related
bombings, suicide bombers, radiological attacks, and chemical nerve agent attacks. 	All team
members are being trained to operate within the National Incident Management Systems
(NIMS) Incident Command System. 	The teams attend stakeholder meetings and training with
the local Hazardous Materials Teams and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management
			38

(VDEM) Regional Hazardous Material Officers. 	Our teams also conduct training quarterly to
maintain certification utilizing assigned Personal Protective Equipment and Self Contained
Breathing Apparatus. 		
The unit has seven specialized response vehicles that are equipped with radiological detection
equipment, Multi-Rae Combustible Gas Indicator equipped with a photo ionization detector to
identify volatile and toxic gases, satellite television capabilities, weather monitoring equipment,
emergency decontamination station and a rehabilitation tent. 	The unit also received three
Hazardous Material Identification Instruments that will allow field analysis of liquids and
powders. 	In addition to this equipment, CCI was recently awarded a DCJS Hazardous
Material Equipment Grant that will further enhance the unit’s ability to interdict/detect potential
and/or developing threats more quickly, with greater accuracy, and through less intrusive
means; thus, reducing the potential exposure to the citizens and the infrastructure of the
Commonwealth. 	These new assets include biological detection instruments, large area
radiological monitoring units, area rays designed to monitor air quality over a large area, and
other safety equipment that will further prepare the Department to sustain hazardous material
operations in accordance with the Federal guidelines that call for 72 hours of sustainability
from the onset of a significant event. 		
	BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000
miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. Uniformed State Police
personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises
and based upon the ability of local law enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible
for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program regarding the enforcement of motor
carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides aerial
support for law enforcement activities and emergency medical evacuations.
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police
services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police
areas that consist of one or more cities and/or counties. Staffing is allocated based upon
workload demands at the city and county level. 		
Enforcement Initiatives to Address Highway Safety
Checkpoint Strikeforce 		
Identifying and removing drunk drivers from the highways of the
Commonwealth of Virginia is a primary objective of State Police
Troopers in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation.
Checkpoint Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that
involves saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on
specific highways and in locations where alcohol related incidents and
arrests have been identified. This national campaign is supported by the
	39 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 43 of 52”
Table: 43
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and involves significant public
education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 		
During 2006, a total of 55,600 vehicles passed through 164 DUI sobriety checkpoints resulting
in 166 drunk driving arrests. Additionally, DUI saturation patrols were conducted on Interstates,
primary and secondary highways throughout Virginia resulting in arrest and the removal 548
alcohol impaired drivers. 				
Operation Air, Land, and Speed 			
In response to an increase in fatal crashes during the first 5 months of 2006, the Virginia State
Police created and implemented an enforcement plan to effectively reduce and eliminate
vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort was also intended to
combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving behavior on Interstates 81 and 95 that
pass through Virginia in the west and in the east respectively. 		
With the success of this program, four enforcement phases were conducted in 2006:

During the 4 enforcement phases conducted throughout the year, there was one fatality
recorded on the involved interstate highways and that was the result of a fleeing stolen vehicle
from another state. 				
Trooper Bowl 				
Trooper Bowl is a high visibility DUI enforcement initiative that has spread throughout the
Commonwealth. It kicked off following a successful initial program conducted on Interstate 66
following the NFL Super Bowl. The primary objective of Trooper Bowl is to identify and arrest
motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and jeopardizing highway safety.
Click-it-or-Ticket 				
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the primary
functions of this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen a steady average increase
in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in 1997, to 78.6 % recorded in 2006. Click-
it-or-Ticket combines public awareness, education, and enforcement to gain compliance with
existing safety belt laws. Increasing the use of safety belts and child safety seats have
statistically shown to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes.
Smooth Operator 				
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative intended, which aims to provide
education, information and solutions for the problem of aggressive driving. For nearly 10 years,
Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have partnered through the Smooth Operator
Program to combat aggressive driving. Law enforcement agencies, trauma experts,
			41 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 45 of 52”
Table: 45
government officials and other professionals have worked together to educate motorists of the
risks involved with aggressive driving, and to stigmatize aggressive driving behavior on our 	
roads. 												
Operation Cruise Control 									
Effective July 1, 2005, the State Police implemented “Operation Cruise Control” to increase 	
visibility and enforcement efforts to address all types of violations and the reckless operations
of a vehicle on Interstate 81 from our border with Tennessee to the West Virginia state line. 	
During the first full year of operation troopers devoted 2,952 additional work hours to Interstate
81 and patrolled 49,790 miles resulting in approximately 4,980 traffic summonses and 102 	
criminal arrests. From the traffic arrests made, 2,695 were for speed violations and 659 arrests
were made for reckless driving. 								
Operation C.A.R.E. 										
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major holidays of 	
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are the primary purposes of
the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.). 					
During 	these 	major 	holiday 	periods 	that 	are 	noted 	for 	increased 	highway 	travel, 	the
Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address highway safety
and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth. 				
Highway Safety Corridors 									
There are currently 3 highway safety corridors in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Two are on
Interstate 95, one in Prince William County and the second in Henrico Country. The other 	
highway safety corridor is on Interstate 81 in Roanoke County. Highway safety corridors were
established as an additional measure to gain driver compliance to posted speed limits and 	
other applicable traffic laws. The corridor locations were determined based on statistical crash
data that identified specific sections of a highway to have a higher than normal crash rate 	
when compared to other segments of the same highway. Establishing the Highway Safety 	
Corridor allows the courts to impose higher penalties for violations cited by police for traffic 	
violations and criminal offenses. 								
A comprehensive review of highway traffic data indicates that within the highway safety 	
corridors traffic crashes are lower than in the previous year, and average vehicle speeds and
driver behavior was improved. Comparing first year data, enforcement statistics indicated a 	
57% increase in arrests for reckless driving arrests in the corridor, and a reduction of 22% for
speeding commercial vehicles in the safety corridor. Overall enforcement increased by 16 	
percent for the two year comparison. 								
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 						
During 2006, each of the department’s seven field divisions continued enforcement emphasis
and visibility on primary and secondary highways within the counties in their divisions. Each
division’s program focused resources on those highways where crashes, traffic violations, and
citizen complaints regarding traffic were noted. The objectives of this initiative were to prevent
crashes, reduce violations, and address the concerns citizens identified as threats to their 	
safety. 												
						42

Table: 46
Safety Division 	
As of December 31, 2006, there were 4,235 active inspection stations located throughout the
Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 14,308 licensed safety inspectors who performed
approximately 7,792,000 inspections at appointed stations during 2006. Approximately 24%
(1,910,000 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe
components. 	
This Division investigated 2,424 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,092 instances of
disciplinary action against 235 stations for various classes of offenses and the suspension of
48 inspection stations. These statistics include administrative errors made by inspection
stations, and the majority of errors/ complaints were corrected by counseling sessions.
Disciplinary action was also taken against 477 safety inspectors, resulting in 171 suspensions.
Safety Division personnel also conducted 1,487 business security checks.
Motor Carrier Safety 	
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety
requirements on Virginia highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety program
regularly present lectures to the public and other interested groups on motor carrier safety and
hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training
seminars. 	
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 51 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2006 and
conducted 179 post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents.
Data indicates that during 2006, Troopers conducted 40,730 in-depth inspections on heavy
commercial vehicles and 9,588 of these, or 23.5 percent, were placed out of service for
violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of hazardous
materials. 	
Field Support 	
The Safety Division’s sworn employees provided support for local field divisions during all
major C.A.R.E. holidays. During 2006, Safety Division troopers had 6,162 arrests/summonses
issued, investigated 59 motor vehicle crashes, assisted local Troopers with the investigation of
113 motor vehicle crashes, and assisted 2,877 disabled motorists.
Aviation Unit 	
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the
administration and coordination of the department’s aviation resources. The Unit’s primary
mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical evacuation.
During its 23 year existence, the Aviation Unit has recorded 87,496 flight hours responding to
58,618 flight requests. 	
The unit utilizes four bases located in the following Virginia localities:
1) 	Lynchburg
	43
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 47 of 52”
Table: 47
2) 	Manassas 	
3) 	Abingdon 	
4) 	Richmond 	
Aircraft 		
The unit operates seven helicopters and four airplanes across Virginia. 	
	 	4 Cessna 182 airplanes 	
	 	4 Bell 407 helicopters 	
	 	1 American Eurocopter BK117 	
	 	2 American Eurocopter B0-105’s 	
The BK117 and BO-105’s are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 	
Medical Evacuation 	
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve Central
and Southwest Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced medical 	
procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients to a level one trauma center. 	
Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the citizens residing in 59 counties and 34
cities. Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to calls for assistance in a
60-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1, 1987 and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began
operations on September 1, 2000, and responds to calls for assistance predominately along
the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. In 2006, all
3 programs responded to a total of 1,725 requests with 1,089 patients transported. The total
number of flights for all three programs from April 1, 1984 to December 31, 2006 was 19,352
responses to calls with 13,395 patients transported as a result of these calls. 	
Search and Rescue 	
During 2006 the Aviation Unit responded to 366 requests for searches for escapees, missing
persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward Looking Infra-Red system on four
helicopters and a 30 million-candlepower searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has
been successful in locating fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. 	During this period the
Unit also recovered $20,000 in stolen property, 9 missing vehicles and 2 missing aircraft. 	As a
result, 16 arrests were made. 	
Surveillance 	
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2006, the Unit was requested
71 times for drug or narcotic surveillance, 57 times for other criminal matters and 19 	
miscellaneous calls. As a result, 21 arrests were made and 13,355 marijuana plants were
located at a value of $1,455,000.00. 	
Other Duties 	
The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any Federal, State, or municipal agency whereby
the solution of a police problem or mission may be obtained. During 2006, the Unit provided
aerial support to 180 requests from agencies external to the Department of State Police. These
flights included photographing crime scenes, providing support for presidential motorcades,
		44

Table: 48
participating in multi-agency task force efforts, and demonstrations of the capabilities of the
Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006, the Aviation Unit
flew 3,563 hours responding to 3,538 flight requests. 						
Motorist Assistance Program 								
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the department currently operates in the four
largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake, Fairfax, Richmond, and
in the Roanoke/Salem areas. 									
During 2006, motorist assistance aides provided assistance to disabled or stranded motorist
on more than 51,421 occasions. 									
State 	Police 	motorist 	assistance 	aides 	provided 	services 	such 	as 	fixing 	flat 	tires, 	providing
gasoline, jump-starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone calls for additional
assistance or to notify family members of a stranded motorist's situation. Motorist Assistance
Aides also were instrumental in the arrest of drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting
erratic driving behavior to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension. 		
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 							
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary 	
responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the
highways of the Commonwealth. During 2006, approximately 19.6 million commercial vehicles
passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for inspection. Through the inspection
of these vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement
Officers issued 60,716 summonses and made 95 criminal arrests. This program is vital to
Virginia's overall highway safety program through the protection of roadways from overweight
and oversized vehicles; through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to
operate on the highways; and through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to
ensure they are properly licensed to operate a commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth.
Crime Prevention 										
During 2006, the department provided specialized training to selected troopers throughout the
State in crime prevention and personal safety. Participating troopers received training in
"Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED), business security and 	
techniques to promote personal safety. All training was part of an intensified crime prevention
