Accreditation 														
In August 2007, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by
the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The
Department 	was 	fully 	compliant 	with 	the 	accreditation 	standards 	and 	received
many favorable reviews from the “public input” component of the evaluation. 	
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA,
as the Department, in 1985, became the second state law-enforcement agency
in the nation to receive official accreditation by CALEA. 					
Maintaining 	accredited 		status 	is 	an 	on-going 	project 	for 	all 	accredited 	law
enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law
enforcement standards. 		In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven
agencies 	awarded 	a 	Certificate 	of 	Meritorious 	Accreditation 	for 	successfully
maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 						
The 	purpose 	of 	the 	accreditation 	process 	is 	to 	improve 	the 	delivery 	of 	law
enforcement 	services 	by 	demonstrating 	that 	an 	agency’s 	operations 	are 	in
compliance 	with 	generally 	accepted 	standards. 	Accreditation 	requires 	a
comprehensive 	review 		of 	every 	aspect 	of 	the 	Department’s 		organization,
operations, and administration. 										
Public Relations Office 										
The 	Public 	Relations 	Office 	(PRO) 	is 	responsible 	for 	planning, 	developing,
managing and implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations
information and educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to
maintaining daily contact with the public and media, the PRO disseminates news
releases about Department programs and activities, traffic safety enforcement,
and crime prevention. The office also develops and implements highway safety
and public awareness media campaigns and conducts press interviews around
the state. 															
The PRO staff consists of a Public Relations Manager and two Public Relations
Coordinators at State Police Administrative Headquarters. The Public Relations
Office assists and supports the Department’s Public Information Officers (PIO)
assigned 	to 	four 	of 	the 	seven 	field 	divisions. 	PIO’s 	respond 	to 	the 	scenes 	of
major highway crashes, criminal incidents, and handle regional press inquiries in
order to assist the media in providing direct and timely information to the public.
In 2009, PRO and PIO accomplishments include: 						
• 	Circulated 62 statewide press releases and 163 divisional press releases; 	
• 	Responded to more than 2,000 statewide and national media inquiries; 	
• 	Assisted local police and sheriffs’ offices with media and crisis management
	during major criminal investigations;

Under the command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs,
operates and maintains land mobile radios, vehicle computers, microwave radios,
integrated flood warning systems and private telephone networks. 	The Statewide
Agencies Radio System (STARS), which will be complete in 2010, will include 131
microwave radio sites, 48 of which also have land mobile radio installations. 	This
responsibility 	includes 	compliance 	with 		requirements 	of 	the 		Federal
Communications 	Commission 	(FCC), 	the 	Federal 	Aviation 	Administration 	(FAA)
and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 						
The 	Division 	is 	staffed 	by 	70 	persons, 	divided 	into 	14 	teams. 	The 	Division 	is

Table: 6
The 	Division 	is 	supporting 		efforts 	of 		the 	Statewide 	Agencies 	Radio 	System
(STARS) 	Program 	Director 	by 	providing 		engineering, 	maintenance, 	inventory
control, asset management, configuration management, and operations services.
The Division also identifies and migrates the existing State Police mobile data, land
mobile 	and 	microwave 	radio 	networks 	that 	will 	be 	upgraded 	to 	serve 	all 	of 	the
Commonwealth’s 	state-level 	public 	safety 		and 	service 	agencies. 	The 	STARS
network is supported 24/7 by the STARS Network Operations Center (NOC). 		
The STARS project now being implemented is providing a private data network
with statewide geographical coverage currently to which units can operate mobile
computer terminals through the radio. 	Mobile data use has now been expanded to
the entire state with supplemental wireless data throughout all divisions. 			
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid
entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The
CAD system consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote
access users. 		A real time data feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate
rapid response to incidents impacting traffic. 										
The 	Virginia 	State 	Police 	CAD 	Management 	Information 	System 	(MIS) 	is 	a
database containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD since March
1999. 	CAD historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. 	The database currently
holds in excess of 6,000,000 records. 	An Intranet Web page allows VSP network
users to create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. 	The
Web 	page 	also 	allows 	user 	access 	to 	weekly 	and 	monthly 	reports. 	The 	MIS
database 	allows 	the 	Department 	to 	track 	and 	access 	information 	never 		before
available, 	such 	as 	average 	response 	times, 	total 		number 	of 	calls, 	and 	average
workloads. 																		
The Mobile Management System provides support for over 2,500 vehicle terminals
currently deployed. 	The users supported include troopers, other state agencies,
and local sheriffs’ offices and police departments. 	This system allows user access
to VCIN/NCIC, text messaging, and for the troopers, full CAD functionality. 			
Telephone 	systems 	and 		cabling 		have 	been 		replaced 	at 	Administrative
Headquarters 		with 	new 	copper 	and 	fiber 	optic 		service. 		Telephone 	system
upgrades 	are 		continuing 	as 	needed 	at 	area 	offices 	and 	division 	headquarters
statewide. 																			
In 	addition 	to 	mission-critical 	communications, 	the 	Communications 	Division
coordinates and supports wireless communications equipment and services. 	The
Division 	constantly 	monitors 	wireless 	services 	to 	provide 	better 	coverage 	and
increased 	technical 	support. 	This 	effort 	supports 	the 	current 	mandated 		budget
reductions 		with 	significant 	savings 	to 	the 		Department 	of 	State 	Police 	and 	the
taxpayers 	in 	the 	Commonwealth. 	These 	services 	make 	Department 	personnel

more 	accessible 	and 	keep 		them 	better 		informed 	regarding 	routine 		and
administrative activities. 	The number of wireless telephones approved and in use
has been reduced to a little over 900 units in support of recent budget reductions.
Current cellular services are allowing the elimination of pagers in most areas of
operations as the wireless carriers build out the more rural areas. 				
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems
for special events as they occur. 										
During 2009 events include: 											
	1. 	Communications 	support 	for 	the 	NASCAR 	races 	held 	twice 	a 	year 	at
		Richmond International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway 				
	2. 	Floydfest Musical Festival 										
	3. 	The Southern Governors Conference held in Williamsburg 				
	4. 	The 2009 Presidential Inauguration 								
	5. 	Numerous 	local 	festivals 	and 	events 	requiring 	security 	and 	traffic 	control
		services 													
	6. 	Security and traffic control for the Virginia State fair in its new location in
		Caroline County 												
All 	field 	division 	radio 	shops 		are 	certified 	as 	independent 	laboratories 	by 	the
Division of Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating 2,840 radar
tuning forks. 	The present inventory of active radars is approximately 1,421 units
and 256 lidar units. 	The majority of Department radars are newer Golden Eagle II
units. 														
The Division provides statewide telephone services and local area network wiring
for 	the 	Department 	and 	other 		state 	agencies. 	The 	Division 	currently 	maintains
approximately 21,500 items of radio equipment for the state’s public service and
public safety agencies. 	The Division will be responsible for over 60,000 items of
STARS equipment once the network is fully implemented. 	Depot level repair will
be 	performed 	in 	the 	Communications 	Division, 	a 	great 	savings 	over 	all 	other
alternatives. 														
The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN) activities to
improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 				
The Communications Division serves as the Virginia’s Frequency Advisor for the
Association 	of 	Public-Safety 	Communications 	Officials 	(APCO), 	the 	Federal
Communications Commission’s designated agent. 	The duties include: 			
	• 	Preparation 	of 	new 	and 	modified 	FCC 	license 	applications 	for 	localities
		and agencies throughout the Commonwealth as requested

		Commonwealth for interference protection of Commonwealth incumbents
	• 	Represent the Commonwealth on Regional Planning Committees 		
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 		
The 	Criminal 		Justice 	Information 	Services 	Division 	is 	responsible 	for 	the
maintenance of all files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation,
monitoring, destruction, and archiving of 	records in accordance with the State
Police Records Retention Schedule. 								
In 	2009, 	the 	Division 	processed 	and 	responded 	to 	3,393 	subpoenas 	and 	234
Freedom of Information Act requests. 							
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 					
The 	Criminal 	Investigative 	Reports 	Section 	received 	and 	processed 	285,818
criminal investigative reports in 2009, a decrease of 9% from 2008. 		
In 	2009, 	the 		Central 	Criminal 	Records 	Exchange 	(CCRE) 	received 	4,384
Notifications 	of 	Suspected 	Alien 	Reporting 	forms 	from 	Virginia 	probation 	and
parole officers subsequent to convictions in circuit courts or referrals to probation
or parole officers or for probation supervision, pursuant to Section 19.2-294.2,
Code of Virginia. 											
The CCRE completed 2,758 expungements of police and court records, or 1,921
less than in 2008, which represents a decrease of 41%. 				
In 2009, the CCRE responded to and completed 116 challenges by citizens to
the existence or accuracy of their criminal history record. The 2008 total was 165.
In 2009, the CCRE received 10,008 name change court orders, a process that
requires the querying of the CCH Name File in order to determine the existence
of a criminal history record, and if determined, results in the addition of the court-
ordered name change to the CCH Name File. 						
In 2009, the CCRE generated 865 Concealed Handgun Permit court notification
letters, an increase of 351, since 2008. The notifications are routinely made to
the circuit court that issued the permit, the court where the case was or will be
adjudicated, 	with 	a 	copy 	forwarded 	to 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 	of 	the
															8
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 48”
Table: 9
jurisdiction 	that 	issued 		the 	permit 		and 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 		of 	the
jurisdiction of the adjudicating court. 													
The CCRE processed 34,381 adult and juvenile fingerprint cards using the NIST
card scanning equipment to scan the mug shot, data enter demographics from
the print cards into the CCH file and scan the fingerprint card bar code. The total
for 2008 was 35,689. 																	
Non-Criminal Justice Program (NCJ) 											
The Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 84,673 fingerprint based
searches and 234,002 name search requests for 2009. 	On February 8, 1996,
the Non Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant
growth 	and 	demand 		for 	criminal 	history 	record 	requests. 	The 	NCJI 		can 	be
accessed 	through 	the 	Department’s 	website. 	This 	interface 	eliminates 	the
requirement 	for 	CCRE 	staff 	to 	receive 	and 	process 	a 	high 	volume 		of 	“paper
record name-search” requests. 														
In 2009, CCRE staff processed 103,989 paper inquiries or 44% and 130,013 or
56% electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average
response 	time 	of 	72 		hours 	or 	less. 	Of 	the 	total 	paper 	record 	name 	search
requests, 	69,222 	inquiries 		were 	submitted 	on 	the 	bar-coded 	criminal 	history
request forms and the remaining 34,767 were submitted on the non bar-coded
forms. 	The 	bar 	coded 	method 	of 	automation 	has 	tremendously 		enhanced
customer service by reducing turn around time. 										
Mental Health File 																	
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the
ability 	to 	purchase 	a 	firearm(s). 	Official 	notifications 	of 	individuals 	in 	these
categories 	are 		received 		from 	clerks 	of 	courts 	upon 	court 	adjudication 	of 	an
individual 	(1) 	acquitted 		by 	reason 		of 	insanity, 	(2) 	involuntarily 	admitted 	to
inpatient 	or 	outpatient 	treatment, 	(3) 	adjudicated 	mentally 		incapacitated 	or
incompetent 	or 	(4) 	is 	the 	subject 	of 	a 	temporary 	detention 	order 	(TDO) 	and
agreed to voluntary admission. 	As of December 31, 2009, there were 20,037
mental 	health 	records 	added 		bringing 	the 	total 	records 	on 	file 	to 	125,588.
Reviewing 	this 		file 	when 	an 	application 	to 	purchase 	is 	being 	processed 	has
prevented the transfer of a firearm in 195 instances in 2009. 						
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 						
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for
employment-licensure purposes have decreased. 									
	• 		The SOR experienced a 14% decrease. 								
	• 		In 2009, there were 162,152 searches. 								
	• 		A decrease of 26,620 searches compared to 2008. 					
																					9
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 10 of 48”
Table: 10
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular,
by 	providing 		personal 	descriptive 	and 	sentencing 	information 	on 		individuals
convicted 	of 	certain 	sex 	crimes. 	Information 	regarding 	registered 		offenders
which includes a photograph is maintained on the internet. 					
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 20,214 fingerprint-based registrations
received since July 1, 1997. 										
		• 	Fingerprint registrations grew 9% from 2008 to 2009. 				
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit 									
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit conducts criminal investigations related to
offenders 	required 	to 	register. 	In 	2009, 	2,651 	criminal 	investigations 	were
initiated, which is an 8% decrease from 2008. 							
The Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual offenders. 	Registered offenders
require semi-annual address verification and an additional verification within 30
days of a change to their home or employment addresses information. 	During
2009, troopers confirmed 16,078 addresses which represents a 9.3% increase in
verifications from 2008. 											
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 					
The Interface consists of 118 Circuit Courts, 130 General District Courts, and 124
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE.
In 	2009, 		an 	estimated 	411,967 	records 	were 	transmitted, 	negating 	the
requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE.
Of all dispositions transmitted, an estimated 9.5% were rejected. 				
In 	February 	2000, 	the 	arrest/disposition 	monitoring 	system 	was 	implemented.
Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated
for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 									
For 	2009, 	notifications 	to 	courts 	and 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 		for 	3,400
individual charges were generated, a decrease of 87.3%, due to the elimination
of computer-generated letters to courts and law enforcement agencies, a costly
process 	that 		yielded 	minimal 	results 	during 	the 	past 	several 		years. 	The
notifications 	were 	generated 	because 	the 	court 	did/could 	not 	include 	the
Document 		Control 	Number 	when 	transmitting 	their 	data 	or 	when 		the 	court
transmitted 	the 	Document 	Control 	Number, 	but 	CCRE 	did 		not 	have 	a
corresponding fingerprint card on file. 									
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 						
As 	of 	December 	31, 	2009, 	there 	were 		211,751 	offenders 		on 	file 	with
commitments 		received 	from 	the 	Virginia 	Department 	of 	Corrections, 	which
accounts for 12.7% of the offenders on file.

The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information 	on 	a 	weekly 	basis. 	The 	Correctional 	Status 	Information 	Interface
improved 	the 	criminal 	history 	information 	by 	providing 	up-to-date 	correctional
information with minimal error. 												
The Microfilm Section 														
This section archived 939,690 documents during 2009, a decrease of 106,831
documents, or 10%, since 2008. 											
Photographic Laboratory 													
The 	Photo 	Lab 	maintains 	records, 	files, 	film, 	and 	responds 		to 	requests 	for
photographs, 	digital 	images, 		and 	court 	enlargements. 	In 	2009, 	there 		were
127,968 	photographic 	prints, 		an 	increase 	of 	4%, 	developed 	for 	use 	by 	sworn
personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal
cases in 2009. 	The lab also received and processed 2,414 compact discs (CD)
due to digital camera use, an increase of 90.4%. During 2009, the Digital Crime
Scene Images (DCSI) processing system was installed within the Photo Lab to
enhance and aid the uploading of crime scene images directly to the Photo Lab
by investigating special agents and troopers. Also in 2009, the Noritsu Digital Lab
System 	was 	purchased 		and 	installed 	to 	replace 	the 	obsolete 	Noritsu 	photo
processing equipment. The new system is designed for the processing of digital
images and replaces the film negative method of processing images. 			
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 						
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and palm
prints from criminal arrests, sex offenders and partial latent fingerprints recovered
from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are located at State
Police 	Administrative 	Headquarters. 	The 	Department 	and 	24 	other 	state 	and
local 	agencies 	have 	access 		to 	the 	system 	through 	terminals 	located 	in 	their
respective 	agencies. 	The 	Global 		Transaction 	Controller 	receives 	Live 		Scan
transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS
systems 	for 	searching 	existing 	criminal 	history 	records 	or 	to 		match 	latent
fingerprints 	against 	know 	criminal 		prints. 	The 	installation 	of 	the 	Electronic
Fingerprint 		Archive 	System 		has 	enhanced 		our 	ability 	to 	store 	and 	retrieve
fingerprint these records. 	Currently, there are 1,958,947 Virginia unique subject
related fingerprint files as part of AFIS. 										
There are 1,958,947 ten-print fingerprint records on file and 108,319 unsolved
latent fingerprints in the database. 	The Slap database has 703,217 images, the
Palm database has 77,489. 													
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest
information, including fingerprints and mugshots, to the State Police and the FBI.
This 	process 	enhances 	an 	agencies 	ability 	to 	detect 	aliases 	and 	outstanding
warrants on arrestees prior to their release.

removal. 																	
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 										
Currently, there are 222 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 285 Live Scan units. 	In
addition, there were 99 Civil Live Scan sites utilizing 123 Live Scan Units. 	A total
of 	59 	criminal 		Live 	Scan 	sites 	are 	submitting 	criminal 	justice 	and 	concealed
weapon applicant information via Live Scan. 	The following is a brief comparison

Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 								
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except
antiques, based on the results of a criminal history record information check on
the 	buyer. 	The 	VFTP 	processed 	287,462 	transactions 	in 	2009, 	which 	is 	the
highest volume of transactions processed in a calendar year since the beginning
of the program in 1989, and a 7% increase in transactions that were processed in
2008. 	Of 	these, 	3,101 	were 	denied 	based 	on 	the 	result 	of 	a 	criminal 	history
record information check or other disqualifying record. 	During 2009, 123 wanted
persons were identified for extraditable offenses, which resulted in the arrest of
72 	individuals 	wanted 	in 	Virginia, 	2 	individuals 	who 	were 	named 	in 	an
outstanding 	warrant 	from 	another 	state. 	In 	2009, 	the 	State 	Police 	requested
1,286 	criminal 		investigations 	related 	to 	the 	illegal 	sale 	or 	attempt 	to 	purchase
firearms. Additionally, during 2008, 810 criminal investigations for illegal sale or
attempts to purchase firearms resulted in 901 (70%) closed arrests. 			
VCheck 																	
																		12
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 13 of 48”
Table: 13
VCheck 	is 	Virginia’s 	Internet 		based 	Instant 		Background 		Check 	program.
Approval numbers are generated in instant clearances, while transactions that
require review or research are routed to the Firearms Transaction Call Center for
processing. 		During 	calendar 		year 	2009, 	approximately 	75% 	of 	the 	total
transactions, 	statewide, 	were 	processed 	via 	the 	Internet. 	As 		on-line 		users
increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and
verification 	processes. 		Additional 	employee 	time 		devoted 	to 	these 		other
processes 	provide 	more 	efficient 	overall 	services 	to 	the 	firearm 	dealers 	and
firearm purchasers and cost savings to the Department and the Commonwealth.
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of
a gun dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller
identification 	number 	for 	qualified 	employees. 	As 	of 	December 		31, 	2009, 	the
State Police issued 9,486 seller identification numbers. 							
Concealed Handgun Permits 													
Since July 1, 1995, 478,226 concealed handgun permits have been issued as
authorized by Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 70,434 were issued in 2009
(26% 	increase) 		by 	Virginia 	Circuit 	Courts. 	During 		2009, 	1,088 		nonresident
concealed 	handgun 	permits 	were 	issued 	by 	the 	State 	Police, 	which 	is 	a 	50%
increase in the volume of nonresident permits issued in 2008. 						
Pursuant 	to 	statute, 	the 	State 	Police 	enters 	the 	permit 	holder’s 	name 	and
description 	in 	the 	Virginia 	Criminal 	Information 	Network 	(VCIN) 		so 	that 	the
permit's 	existence 	and 	current 	status 	will 	be 	made 	known 	to 	law-enforcement
personnel accessing the Network for investigative purposes. 		As of December
31, 	2009, 	there 	were 	213,000 	active 	concealed 	handgun 	permits 	issued 	by
Virginia circuit courts maintained in VCIN. 										
Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) 							
The Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) Section is responsible
for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing
law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different criminal offenses.
The 	UCR/IBR 	office 	no 	longer 	accepts 	summary 	hardcopy 	reports 	or 	data
submitted by diskettes. 	Data is submitted via the Internet through the IBR Web
site. 	This 	is 	a 	secure 		system 	to 	which 	only 	State 	Program 	personnel 	and
contributing agencies have access. 		Each day submitted files are run through the
edit process. 		This procedure generates an error report so that agencies may
correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database.
A 	monthly 	file 	of 	Virginia’s 	data 	is 	generated 		and 	emailed 	to 	the 	National
Program 	(FBI) 	for 	inclusion 	in 	their 	annual 	publication, 	Crime 		in 	the 	United
States. 																		
During 2009, the UCR/IBR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with
training 	issues, 		interpretation 	of 	error 	reports, 	and 	clarifications 	in 	offense
definitions 	and 	reporting 	procedures, 	as 	well 	as 	assisted 	computer 	software
vendors 	with 		reporting 	issues. 	Agencies 	were 		asked 	to 	review 	over 	35,000
																		13
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 14 of 48”
Table: 14
offenses 	regarding 	quality 	control 	issues, 		make 	the 	necessary 	changes 	and
resubmit 	their 	data. 	The 	IBR 	responded 		to 	an 	estimated 	5,000 	phone 	calls
regarding varied IBR issues from agencies and vendors as well as receiving or
sending over 3,000 messages using electronic mail. 							
There are 20 private vendors with software that transforms agency crime data
into an approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their
own 	in-house 	software 	systems. 		Monthly 		and 	quarterly 	statistical 	reports 	are
now 	posted 	on 	the 	IBR 	Web 	site 	rather 		than 	having 	to 	be 	mailed 	to 	each
contributing agency. 	The UCR/IBR office responded daily to requests for crime
statistics 	from 	state 	agencies, 	government 	officials, 	students, 	media, 	and 	the
general public. 																
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter as well as, the annual
report, 	Crime 	in 	Virginia. 	Commonwealth’s 	Attorneys, 	judges, 	legislators, 	and
other state agencies are also informed of the availability of Crime in Virginia. 	In
2004, 	this 	annual 	report 	was 	published 		for 	the 	first 	time 	on 	a 	CD 	rather 	than
hardcopy. 	Beginning in 2007, the annual report has been available exclusively
through 	the 	State 	Police 	Web 	site. 	This 	report 	contains 	Group 	A 	offenses
submitted by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B
arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 		These data comprise the official crime
statistics for Virginia and are used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate
forecasting, and in the legislative process. 										
The IBR contributing agency Web site went into production in 2002. 	Currently,
there are 281 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through
the 	Internet. 	This 	Web 	site 	provides 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	with 	the
convenience 	of 	on-line 	monthly 	data 	submission, 	receiving 		timely 		error
notifications, 	monthly 	and 	year-to-date 	statistical 	reports, 	performing 	searches
and 	ad 	hoc 	reporting, 	viewing 	manuals, 	bulletins, 	and 	posting 	inquiries 	in 	the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. 										
The 2009 Crime in Virginia report offenses will be available in the spring of 2010.
Beginning in 2008, these crime data have been formatted and published within
the IBR Unit resulting in a reduction of actual expense as well as allowing an
earlier distribution date. 														
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information
Center (NCIC) 																
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 689 member agencies with 29,032 certified
operators. 	The system has 11,975 terminals, a major increase of 1,320 terminals
over the number of terminals at the close of 2008. 	Of these terminals, there are
3,455 	non-mobile 	terminals. 	This 	number 	has 	remained 	stable 	over 	the 	past
year. 	Mobile 	terminals 	have 	increased 		to 	8,520 	from 	7,509. 	In 	2009, 	VCIN
processed approximately 403,986,381 transactions (an increase of 8% over the
																		14
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 15 of 48”
Table: 15
2008 	totals) 	between 	NCIC/NLETS 		member 	agencies 	and 		state 	computer
databases. 																
Virginia 	agencies 	entered 	numerous 		types 	of 	information 	in 	the 	VCIN/NCIC
system, 	which 	is 	critical 	to 	law 	enforcement 	officers. 		As 	an 	example, 	these
systems 	store 	information 	relating 	to 	wanted 	persons, 	missing 	persons, 	and
stolen vehicles, and protective orders. 		Enhancements in the “E-Magistrate” and
“Hotfiles” 	systems 	have 	improved 	the 	statistical 	information 	available 	through
VCIN/NCIC. 	In 2008 VCIN/NCIC retained Virginia information relating to 48,096
wanted persons. 	However, in 2009, 174,415 warrants were issued through “E-
Magistrate” and were related to 48,702 wanted persons on file in VCIN/NCIC.
This 	represented 	less 	than 	a 	1% 	increase 	over 	2008. 	VCIN/NCIC 	currently
retains Virginia information for 1,816 missing adults, 12,133 missing children, and
11,629 stolen vehicles. 														
2009 was the first year that system enhancements allowed VCIN to track the
number 	of 	protective 	order 	transactions 	throughout 	the 	period 	instead 	of 	the
number 	of 	orders 	on 	file 	at 	any 	given 	time. 	Accordingly, 	there 	were 	13,775
Orders 	of 	Protection, 		13,318 	Preliminary 	Protective 	Orders, 		and 	36,467
Emergency Protective Orders entered into the VCIN system during 2009. 		
E-Magistrate 																
The 	Supreme 	Court 	of 	Virginia 	now 	has 	an 	automated 		interface 	called 	E-
Magistrate. 	In 	2009 		this 	automated 	interface 	came 	on-line 		for 	all 	law
enforcement agencies obtaining warrants from magistrates in their jurisdictions.
This 	interface 	permits 	felonies 	and 		misdemeanor 	warrants 	and 	Emergency
Protective Orders issued by magistrates to be presented to VCIN terminals for
acknowledgement and entry from into VCIN and NCIC. 	This is a similar interface
from the Courts Management Information System currently being used by the
courts to enter Preliminary Protective Orders and Final Orders of Protection. 	
The interface works as follows: 											
• 	Within 30 minutes of issuance of the warrant or protective order, a VCIN
	message will be generated by the VCIN hot files interface to the terminal
	for the BFO division that is consistent with one of the jurisdictions within
	that division. 														
• 	The message will be transmitted through the interface via VCIN to the ORI
	of record, based upon information provided to the magistrate by the law
	enforcement agency that we may have record holder agreements with, for
	other agencies. 														
																	15
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 48”
Table: 16
• 	Upon 	entry 	from 	the 	E-magistrate/VCIN 	interface, 	all 	records 	will 	be
	available 	but 	deemed 	“unacknowledged” 	until 	modified 	by 	the 	record
	agency. 															
	o 	“Unacknowledged” records will not be available for immediate HIT
		confirmation 	because 	the 	hardcopy 	of 	the 	document 	may 	still 	be
		en-route to the primary record agency. 	Therefore, the record will
		provide a hit in Virginia only, and agencies must be aware the legal
		document 	may 	still 	be 	at 	the 	magistrate’s 	office 	and 	the 	law
		enforcement 	agencies 	need 	to 	verify 	and 	obtain 	the 	documents
		before taking police action. 										
	o 	After the entry is acknowledged NCIC records will automatically be
		generated 	and 	hits 	will 	be 	generated 	by 	any 	querying 	agency.
		Therefore, upon receipt of the document from the magistrate, law
		enforcement agency personnel are required to deliver an original
		document or fax a copy to their communications centerithout delay
		until the original can be delivered. 								
• 	Upon 	receipt 	of 	the 	hardcopy 	of 	the 	document, 	the 	Communications
	Center staff will run a QW inquiry to ensure that the document has been
	entered into VCIN (You will be able to query by warrant number or offense
	tracking number WNO). 											
• 	Warrants are acknowledged by a modifying transaction (MW). 	Protective
	Orders are routed directly to NCIC and VCIN when entered and do not
	need to be acknowledged by modifying transaction (MPO). 				
• 	Documents can also be immediately cleared (CW) or (CPO) or canceled
	(XW) or (XPO) upon receipt if required. 								
	o 	To 	reiterate; 		acknowledgment 	of 	the 	VCIN 	entry 	automatically
		generates 	an 	NCIC 	entry. 		To 	successfully 	enable 	the 	entry 	into
		NCIC, the record must be checked for accuracy to ensure that it will
		pass all NCIC edits prior to acknowledgement. 					
• 	Acknowledgement can take place if the record is correct and modification
	includes completion of the acknowledgement field (ACK). 	Message field
	code 	(ACK) 	must 		include 	code 	“Y” 	to 	indicate 	that 	the 	record 	is
	acknowledged. 	The same fields and edits that have always been required
	for entry have not changed. 											
• 	Law 	enforcement 	agencies 	will 	need 	to 	contact 	their 	Communication
	Center immediately after receiving the warrant. The person obtaining the
	legal document shall verify the entry, ensure any additional information is
																	16
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 17 of 48”
Table: 17
	provided or added to the entry and confirm that they have the warrant in
	their possession or when it will be delivered. 						
This new interface is going to provide a benefit to Virginia law enforcement and
speed 	the 	entry 	of 	warrants 	and 	protective 	orders 	into 	VCIN 	and 	NCIC. 	After
receipt 	of 	a 	document, 	charging 	a 	person 		with 	a 	felony 	or 	violation 	of 	§18.2-
472.1, appropriate wanted information will be immediately entered into the NCIC
and VCIN systems (excluding juvenile petitions unless the juvenile will be tried as
an adult and any felony documents that will be served within the 24 hours). 	As a
result of the new interface our Communications Center and Virginia agencies will
now have this information available for entry within 30 minutes of the magistrate
issuing 	and 	entering 	the 	warrant 	or 	Emergency 	Protective 	Order 	into 	the
Supreme 		Court 	of 	Virginia 	E-Magistrate 		System. 	As 	another 	benefit, 	this
functionality will reduce data entry required by staff. 						
Availability of Department of Motor Vehicle Images via VCIN 			
Virginia DMV images are available to Virginia law enforcement agencies through
the Virginia State Police, Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) using the
OpenFox Messenger application. 	Alternatively, they will be available to interface
agencies 		that 	have 	completed 	the 	programming 	to 	their 	VCIN 	interface 	as
advised. 		In 2009, the VCIN system processed an average of 30,000 requests
per month from law enforcement agencies for DMV Images. 				
The 	laws 	and 	policies 	governing 	the 	use 	and 	dissemination 	of 	all 	DMV
information remain the same. 	The images are to be used exclusively for criminal
justice 	purposes 	unless 	specified 	otherwise 	herein. 	The 	DMV 	information,
including images, will not be retained or 	used for any purpose other than the
intended 	purpose 	for 	which 	it 	was 	obtained. 		It 	will 	not 	be 	used 	for 	public
dissemination unless the subject of the image is known and verified to be the
subject in question and, the use is related to the purpose for which the image
was obtained. 														
If the subject of the images meets the verification standard above, permissible
public dissemination will include use in a wanted poster, a line-up targeted to the
subject and his specific description, publicizing a missing person incident or an
incident 	where 	the 	location 	of 	an 	offender 	would 	enhance 	public 	and 	officer
safety. 	Random 	use 	of 	DMV 	images 	for 	line-ups 	or 	use 	of 	DMV 	images
combined with local agency mug-shot files is prohibited. 					
Additionally, images will be available through NLETS from DMVs in participating
states. 	Due to concerns regarding the impact to available bandwidth, as a result
of excessive image requests, interface agencies are not to request the image
unless it is needed. Automating or bundling queries to automatically run the two
transactions required by the system to return images with each driver’s license
query is prohibited.

Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse 					
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse was formed by act of
the Virginia General Assembly on July 1, 1983. 	The clearinghouse is to assist in
the implementation of federal and state laws relating to missing children, and the
inclusion 	of 	programs 	to 	coordinate 	efforts 	between 	local, 	state, 	and 	federal
agencies in recovering missing children and promoting community awareness of
the issue. 	The Clearinghouse operates as Virginia’s center for missing children
administered through the Virginia Department of State Police. The clearinghouse
is linked to all Virginia law enforcement agencies through the VCIN system and
all 	United 	States 	police 	agencies 	through 	NCIC 	and 	the 	National 	Center 	for
Missing and Exploited Children. 									
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse has also joined efforts
with 	the 	U.S. 		Department 	of 	Justice 	to 	educate 	Virginia’s 	fifth 	grade 	students
about safety issues through a national poster contest with a theme of “Bring Our
Missing Children Home.” 	A single winner from Virginia will be recognized and
have their entry submitted for a national judging competition by the Department
of 	Justice. 		If 	they 	win 	the 	national 	competition, 	the 	artwork 	will 	become 	the
theme for all DOJ Missing Children publications in 2011. 					
Virginia Amber Alert System 									
A 	new 	system 	was 	developed 	in 	March 	2006 	to 	automate 	the 	entry 	and
notification process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 	The system is designed to
provide a comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the
safe recovery of a child and capture of 	the abductor. 	Local law enforcement
agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request form, enter the
information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 	The system has
significantly reduced the time required to get this information out to the public. 	
In 2009, seven (7) requests were received for an AMBER ALERT activation and
two (2) met the criteria and were activated. 	In some cases in which the criteria
was not met an Endanger Missing Child Alert was offered to assist the requesting
law enforcement agency and three (3) of these alerts were activated. 		
Virginia Senior Alert Program 									
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia Assembly created the Virginia
Senior 	Alert 		Program. 	This 	program, 	managed 	by 	the 	Criminal 		Justice
Information Service Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police to
publicize an incident of a missing senior adult. 	When activated, the information is
publicized at www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our media partners.
In 2009, the Senior Alert process was activated on five occasions. 		
Finance Division 										
															18
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 19 of 48”
Table: 19
The Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial functions, including
the preparation of, monitoring, and accounting for the Department’s annual budget
in excess of $264 million for 2009, including approximately $14.4 million of federal
grants (of which $582 thousand is from the American Reinvestment and Recovery
Act for the Northern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force). 			
The 	Finance 	Division 	processes 	payments 	to 	vendors 	in 	accordance 	with
established policies and procedures issued by various entities, including, but not
limited to the State Department of Accounts and Federal agencies. 	Payments are
processed in compliance with the “Prompt Payment Act.” 						
Security, patrol services and background information is routinely provided to other
state 	agencies, 	localities 	and 	private 	entities 	for 	which 	the 	Department 	seeks
reimbursement. 		The 	Finance 	Division, 	along 	with 	other 		Divisions 		of 	the
Department, 		bills 	for 	these 	services 	provided 	by 	the 	Department. 	It 	is 	the

Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents work
closely with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance
Crimes Bureau, and federal and local law enforcement agencies to investigate
crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other illegal
activity. 																		
In 	2009, 	the 	Special 	Agents 	conducted 	124 		motor 	vehicle 	theft 	investigations,
resulting in 42 arrests and the recovery of 43 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy
equipment 	with 	a 	combined 	value 	of 	$1,187,655. 	They 	also 	conducted 	102
vehicle 	ID 	verifications 	for 	other 	federal, 	state, 		and 	local 		law 	enforcement
agencies. 																	
Auto 		Theft 	Agents 	coordinate 	monthly 	regional 	meetings 	with 	other 	auto 	theft
investigators 	and 	insurance 	company 	special 	investigative 		units 	across 	the
Commonwealth 	of 	Virginia. 	These 	meetings 	are 	held 	to 	discuss 	current
automobile 	theft 	trends 	and 	coordinate 		enforcement 		efforts 		among 	law
enforcement 	agencies. 	In 	addition, 	members 	of 	the 	unit 	provide 	auto 	theft
investigation training to numerous Troopers and local law-enforcement officers at
the Virginia State Police Academy and at regional training academies. 		
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – This is an insurance industry-funded
program 	established 	in 	1992 	by 	Section 		38.2-414 	of 	the 	Code 		of 	Virginia 	to
receive auto theft related tips and to provide cash rewards to the callers. 	The
H.E.A.T. 	Program 	also 	provides 	leadership 	and 	assistance 	to 	more 	than 	175
state 		and 	local 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 		throughout 	Virginia 		by 	providing
																			29

Table: 30
training; 	conducting 	promotional 	events, 	prevention 	seminars 	and 	VIN 	Etching
events; offering grant funding and procuring specialized equipment. 				
H.E.A.T. 	also 	conducts 		two 	basic 	and 	one 	advanced 	auto 	theft 	investigation
school for law enforcement annually. 	H.E.A.T., with the assistance of the Virginia
Crime Prevention Association, also presents instruction in auto theft prevention
to 	crime 	prevention 	specialists 	and 	Operation 	HEATWave 		Coordinators
numerous 	times 	throughout 	the 	year. 		To 	enhance 	Virginia’s 	auto 	theft
investigative abilities, the H.E.A.T. office provides training scholarships for local
auto 	theft 	investigators 	to 	receive 	specialized 	training 	conducted 	by 	the
International Association of Auto Theft Investigators. 						
The H.E.A.T. office coordinates the deployment of bait cars that are used in high
theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 	Mobile Data Hunter
vehicles have also been deployed throughout the state to locate stolen vehicles.
The 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 		works 	to 	increase 	the 	public’s 	awareness 	about 	the
problem of auto theft, auto theft prevention devices and strategies by using a
variety of marketing strategies, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-HEAT) and cash
rewards. 		Citizens 		are 	directed 	to 	the 	H.E.A.T. 	Web 	Site 		at:
www.HeatReward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The public
is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they have any auto theft related
information. 														
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted
in a momentous reduction in Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 	1991, 	Virginia’s
motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately
34 percent. 														
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – In 1999, the General Assembly approved
the establishment of an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Bureau
of Criminal Investigation. The purpose of the program is to: 					
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when
	the Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or
	is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent
	of such insurance fraud; 											
2. 	Respond to notifications or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by
	federal, 	state 	and 	local 	police, 	other 	law-enforcement 	authorities,
	governmental agencies or Units, and any other person; 					
3. 	Review 	notices 	and 	reports 	of 	insurance 	fraud; 	select 	the 	incidents 	of
	suspected 	fraud 	that, 	in 	its 	judgment, 	require 	further 	detailed 		investigation;
	and conduct the investigations. 									
															30
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 31 of 48”
Table: 31
Recent 	examples 	of 	insurance 	fraud 	include 	faking 	auto 	crashes, 	staging
burglaries, 	fraudulently 	reporting 	theft, 	and 	falsifying 	Workers’ 	Compensation
injuries. The IFP is constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed
at fraudulently receiving claim funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has
a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of
claimed 	loss 	that 	was 	actually 	received 	by 	individuals 	submitting 	suspected
insurance 		fraud 	claims. 		During 	2009, 	more 		than 	$3,000,000 	was 	actually
collected 	by 	individuals 	suspected 		of 	insurance 	fraud 	and 	the 	total 	amount
involved 	in 	suspicious 		claims 	that 	was 	attempted, 	but 	not 	collected, 	was 	over
$15,000,000. 																
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as
$1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services. This Program is dedicated
to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens
of 	Virginia 	and 	raising 	public 	awareness 	of 	insurance 	fraud. 	This 	is
accomplished 	through 		a 	toll-free 	hotline, 	1-877-62FRAUD 	(1-877-623-7283),
which citizens can call with information about suspected insurance fraud, as well
as 	a 	web 	site, 	www.StampOutFraud.com, 	which 	is 	available 	for 	reporting
suspected insurance fraud. 												
In 2009, 1,484 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward
program 	has 	been 	established 	to 	provide 	a 	reward 	of 	up 	to 	$25,000 	for
individuals having a Sharp Eye and reporting information leading to the arrest
and/or 	conviction 	of 	individuals 	committing 	insurance 	fraud. 	In 	2009, 	the
Insurance Fraud Program paid out $24,500 in rewards. 	Since its inception, the
program has paid out over $70,000 to those individuals that have a “Sharp Eye”
and reported insurance fraud. 												
During 	2009, 	2,078 	notifications 	of 	potential 	property 	and 	casualty 	insurance
fraud were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and
the general public. There were 686 criminal investigations initiated by the Special
Agents and 158 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. 	One hundred
and nine insurance fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered
restitution of $495,527 during 2009. 											
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 									
DES 	continues 	in 	its 	aggressive 		enforcement 	of 	Virginia’s 	narcotics 	and
substance abuse laws. The Section remains committed to its support of local law
enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional
field offices also help in this effort by supporting special operations initiated by
other law enforcement entities. 											
The 	DES 	mission 	is 	accomplished 	through 	the 	efforts 	of 	sworn 	members 	and
civilian support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 					
																		31
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 32 of 48”
Table: 32
	• 	DES Regional Field Offices 													
	• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 											
	• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 											
	• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 								
	• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations 													
	• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 											
In 	2009, 	DES 	field 	offices 	participated 	in 	1,968 	investigations 		that 	yielded
$33,612,898 in seized narcotics, $284,178 in seized currency, and 381 persons
arrested 	on 	680 	felony 	and 	misdemeanor 	charges. 		In 	addition, 		735 	persons
were arrested on 1,194 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES
assisted 	other 	agencies. 	Special 	Agents 		also 		seized 	41 	vehicles 	and 	102
weapons. 	Additionally, 10 actual meth labs were dismantled. 					
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – During 2009, DES participated in 36 state
and 	local 	multi-jurisdictional 		task 	forces, 	encompassing 	107 	local 		jurisdictions.
These 	multi-jurisdictional 	task 	forces 	participated 	in 	5,267 	investigations 	that
accounted 	for 	$15,100,323 		in 	illicit 	drug 	seizures, 		$820,846 	in 		seized 	U.S.
currency, and 3,311 persons arrested on 4,665 charges. 		These task forces also
seized 140 vehicles and 349 weapons. 												
Marijuana 	Eradication 	Program 	– 	The 		Commonwealth 	remains 	a 	prime
location for the cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown
marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop. With DEA funding, the
Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local law
enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard Reconnaissance
Air 	Interdiction 	Detachment 		(RAID), 	conducted 		a 	regular 	program 	to 	eradicate
domestically-grown 	marijuana. 	In 	2009, 		the 		State 		Police 	and 		local 	law
enforcement agencies found 13,227 plants in 312 outdoor plots. There were also
5,356 	marijuana 	plants 	eradicated 	in 	97 	indoor 	grows. 		Marijuana 	eradication
operations resulted in 377 arrests. 		Seizures included 154 weapons, vehicles,
and other personal property valued at $695,204. 		Considering the estimated yield
of 	consumable 	marijuana 	from 	each 	plant, 	the 		cash 	value 	of 	marijuana 	not
reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $86 million.
Governor’s 	Initiative 	Against 	Narcotics 	Trafficking 	(GIANT) 	– 	The 	GIANT
mission is to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member
agencies. 	The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 								
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both
	indoor 	and 	outdoor, 	with 	the 	eradication 	of 	this 		marijuana 	and 	successful
	prosecution of the growers as a primary goal; 										
																			32
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 33 of 48”
Table: 33
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts
	to monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth,
	and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 					
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway;
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns
	in 	communication 	among 	the 	various 	state 	agencies 	and 		law 	enforcement
	authorities, and; 																
5. 	Utilizing 	the 	resources 	of 	county 	and 	city 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	to 	the
	maximum extent possible. 													
GIANT performed 450 operations during 2009 that resulted in 290 arrests, and
the seizure of $41,160,763 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 137 weapons,
17 vehicles, and $135,898 in U.S. currency. 									
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents
work with the DEA, the Department of Health Professions, and the Department of
Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies to eliminate
the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes. 						
During 	2009, 	Drug 		Diversion 	received 	1,135 	complaints 	of 	diversion 	activities
throughout 	the 	Commonwealth. 		In 	response 		to 	these 	complaints, 	1,098
investigations 	were 		initiated. 	A 	total 	of 	739 	persons 	were 	arrested 	on 	1,060
charges. 	Additionally, 19 search warrants were executed during the past year.
A 	major 	educational 	role 	of 	Drug 	Diversion 	is 	teaching 	local 		law 	enforcement
officials about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions
and what they can do about it. 	This role also included educating health care
professionals, 	both 		physicians 	and 	pharmacists, 	about 	the 	magnitude 	of 	the
problem 	and 	the 	importance 	of 	self-policing 	and 		ensuring 	the 	integrity 	of 	their
individual 	health 	care 	delivery 	systems. 	During 	2009, 	6 	presentations 	were
conducted for 165 healthcare professionals, and 8 presentations were conducted
for 518 individuals in law enforcement. 	The Drug Diversion Unit, with assistance
from the Department of Health Professions and the National Association of Drug
Diversion 	Investigators 	(N.A.D.D.I.), 	hosted 	the 		Ninth 	Annual 	Drug 	Diversion
School in Norfolk, Virginia. 														
Criminal Intelligence Division 											
The 	primary 	purpose 	of 	the 	Criminal 	Intelligence 	Division 	(CID) 	is 	to 	identify,
document, and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in
organized 	crime 	or 	terrorism. 		CID 	is 	currently 	composed 	of 	five 	units; 	the
Analytical 	Unit, 	the 		Research 	Unit, 	the 	Field 	Intelligence 	Unit 		and 	the 	Virginia
Fusion Center. 																	
																			33
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 34 of 48”
Table: 34
The Research Unit assists the other CID units with specific research tasks, field
investigations 	including 	surveillance, 	officer 	safety 	issues, 	the 	handling 	of
fictitious identifications for undercover personnel and serves as the Department’s
primary 	INTERPOL 	liaison. 		INTERPOL 	has 	now 	established 	a 	secure 	VPN
connection with the Department. 	This connection has simplified and expedited
the communication process with INTERPOL. 								
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide
to collect and supply intelligence, including information on current investigations.
The unit also uses the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The
unit 	is 	active 	in 	each 	of 	the 	Department’s 	seven 	field 	divisions. 		The 	Field
Intelligence Unit also has five agents assigned to the various FBI Joint Terrorism
Task Forces. 																
In 	2009, 	the 	Department 	was 	instrumental 	in 	securing 	the 	participation 	of 	the
Department of Corrections (DOC) in the Washington-Baltimore HIDTA GangNet
Intelligence System initiative. 		This multi-state regional system continues to be
populated 	with 	gang 		related 	information 	by 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	in
Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia. 	Additional states on the east coats are
expected to join GangNet in the near future. 								
The Research Unit continues to work with over 350 user agencies throughout the
Commonwealth 	by 	providing 		training 	and 	guidance 	in 	the 	use 	of 	the 	TIPS
system. 	The Research Unit also works with public safety agencies statewide to
provide 	them 	with 		the 	Homeland 	Security 	Information 	System-Virginia 	(HSIN-
VA), a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that will allow intelligence to be posted on
a 	three-tiered 	system 	ranging 	from 	law 	enforcement, 	emergency 	management
personnel, critical infrastructure companies in both the private and public sector
and the general public. 	CID is currently working with the Information Technology
Division to develop a new Virginia Intelligence Management System (VIMS) that
will eventually replace TIPS. 												
The 	Virginia 	Fusion 		Center 	(VFC) 		gathers, 	analyzes 	and 	disseminates
information 	and 	intelligence 		as 	it 	relates 	to 	all 	criminal 	activity 	to 	include
terrorism. 	This joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the Virginia
Department 		of 	Emergency 		Management 	is 	the 	first 	of 	its 	kind 	in 	the
Commonwealth. Its primary mission is to “fuse” together resources from local,
state 	and 	federal 		agencies 		and 	private 	industries 	to 	facilitate 	information
collection, analysis and sharing, in order to prevent or deter criminal activity. 	Its
secondary mission is to support the co-located Virginia Emergency Operations
Center by centralizing information and resources to provide a coordinated and
effective response in the event of an attack or natural disaster. 				
The 	VFC 	operates 	the 	Terrorism 	Hotline 	and 	the 	Drug 	Hotline 	which 	are
initiatives 	that 	provide 	a 	conduit 	for 	the 	public 	to 	provide 	information 	on 	both
terrorist 	and 	criminal 	activities. 		The 	Homeland 	Security 	Information 	Network,
																		34
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 35 of 48”
Table: 35
Virginia Portal (HSIN-VA) allows for public and private entities that have a need
and right to access certain databases a method of retrieving common operating
picture 	information. 	The 	VFC’s 	Critical 	infrastructure/Key 	Resource 	(CI/KR)
program 	is 	not 	only 	cataloging 	important 	infrastructure 	throughout 	the
Commonwealth, but is providing training to state and local first responders on
crime prevention and target hardening for sites in their jurisdictions. 	The Fusion
Liaison 	Officer 		(FLO) 	program 		is 	training 	first 	responders 	in 	what 	suspicious
activities could be precursors to criminal or terrorist activity and how to report the
information to the VFC. 										
High Tech Crimes Division 							
The High-Tech Crimes Division (HTCD) was created August 1, 2009, in an effort
to consolidate the agency’s multiple cyber initiatives under a single command,
and enhance the agency’s capacity to conduct cyber-crime investigations, digital
forensic 	analysis, 	and 	child 		exploitation/pornography 	investigations. 	This
endeavor 	incorporates 	High-Tech 	Crimes 	Agents 	from 	each 	geographical 	field
division, the Computer Evidence Recovery Section, the Northern Virginia/District
of Columbia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (NOVA-DC ICAC), and
the Technical Support Section. 									
High-Tech Crimes and NOVA-DC ICAC: 						
The personnel assigned to this section have conducted numerous cyber-crime
investigations, 		and 	assisted 		local, 	state, 	federal, 	and 	international 	law
enforcement personnel combat these complex crimes. 	In addition, the year-to-
date measures reflect that personnel in this section are responsible for providing
training 	to 	8200 	law 	enforcement 	officers, 	making 	170 	arrests 	involving 	child
pornography and child exploitation, conducting 173 digital forensic examinations,
and processing 304 CyberTips received from the National Center for Exploited
and Missing Children (NCMEC). 								
Computer Evidence Recovery Section: 						
The 	Computer 		Evidence 	Recovery 	Unit 	(CERU) 	provides 	assistance 	to 	local,
state and federal law enforcement agencies with no-scene execution of search
warrants 	for 	computer-related 		evidence, 	evidence 	recovery 	through 	forensic
examination, and training classes in computer search and seizure. 	In 2009, the
CERU received 124 requests for service and completed 87 investigations on 400
computers 	and 	other 	pieces 	of 	digital 	evidence 	involving 	39,262 	gigabytes 	of
data. 	The CERU also handled 1,607 internet fraud complaints and provided 151
hours of instruction on computer crime.

Technical Support Unit: 											
The Technical Support Unit (TSU) provides technical and surveillance support to
local, state, and federal law enforcement. 	The year-to-date measures reflect the
section received 1,444 requests for service. 	Of these requests, 89 involved the
installation and operation of closed circuit television systems for victims of child
abuse 	cases 		in 	various 	courts. 	Additionally, 	the 	TSU 	responded 	to 	17
Hostage/Barricade 	Incident 	requests. 		The 	complex 	and 	covert 	nature 	of 	this
special 	group 		has 	been 	instrumental 	in 	the 	successful 	investigation 	and
prosecution 	of 	numerous 	criminal 	matters 	and 	is 	absolutely 	essential 	to 	the
continued success of the organization’s mission. 							
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 			
CCI was established in 2003 to interdict narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public
transportation 	systems, 	schools 	and 	businesses. 		Additionally, 	CCI 	provides
seven regional response teams to address chemical, nuclear and bio-terrorism
events. 	In 	2005, 	the 	mission 	of 	CCI 	evolved 	to 	incorporate 	a 	new 	strategic
initiative developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes.

		BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 				
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of
over 64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia.
Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal
law 	enforcement 	as 	the 	need 	arises 	and 	based 	upon 	the 	ability 	of 	local 	law
enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor
Vehicle Safety Inspection Program regarding the enforcement of motor carrier
and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides
aerial 	support 		for 	law 	enforcement 	activities 	and 	emergency 	medical
evacuations. 															
The 	Commonwealth's 	geography 	and 	size 	dictate 	the 	need 	to 	decentralize
uniformed police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further
subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or
counties. 	Staffing 	is 	allocated 	based 	upon 	workload 	demands 	at 	the 	city 	and
county level.

Public Safety 														
Checkpoint Strikeforce 													
Identifying 	and 		removing 	drunk 		drivers 	from 	the 	highways 	of 	the 		
Commonwealth 		of 	Virginia 	is 	a 	primary 	objective 	of 	State 	Police 		
Troopers in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation. 		
Checkpoint Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that 		
involves saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on 		
specific highways and in locations where alcohol related incidents and arrests
have 	been 	identified. 	This 	national 	campaign 	is 	supported 	by 		the 	National
Highway 	Traffic 		Safety 	Administration 	(NHTSA) 	and 	involves 	significant 	public
education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 						
During 	2009, 	a 	total 	of 	10,600 	vehicles 	passed 	through 	15 		DUI 	sobriety
checkpoints 	resulting 	in 	26 	drunk 	driving 	arrests. 	Additionally, 	DUI 	saturation

Operation Air, Land, and Speed 									
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and
implemented 	an 	enforcement 	plan 	in 	July, 	2006, 	to 	effectively 	reduce 	and
eliminate vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort
was also intended to combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving
behavior 	on 	Interstates 	that 	pass 	through 	Virginia 	to 	make 	travel 	in 	our
Commonwealth safe and enjoyable for motorists. 						
With the success of this program, six enforcement phases were conducted in

Grand Total All Phases = 114,199 											
During 	the 	6 	enforcement 	phases 	conducted 	throughout 	the 	year 	2009, 	there
was only one fatal crash on the involved interstate highways where enforcement
was increased and visibility heightened. Virginia has experienced only three fatal
crashes since the program’s inception. 										
Click-it-or-Ticket 															
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the
primary 	functions 	of 	this 	national 	and 	statewide 	initiative. 	Virginia 	has 	seen 	a
steady average increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in
1997, to 82.36 % recorded in 2009. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness,
education, 	and 	enforcement 	to 	gain 	compliance 	with 	existing 	safety 	belt 	laws.
Increasing the use of safety belts and child safety seats have statistically shown
to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes. 			
During the May phase of Click-it-or-Ticket 	state police personnel issued 1,981
summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 585 summonses for child safety
restraint violations. 														
Smooth Operator 														
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative intended, which aims
to 	provide 	education, 	information 	and 	solutions 	for 	the 	problem 	of 	aggressive
driving. For more than 10 years, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have
partnered through the Smooth Operator Program to combat aggressive driving.
Law 	enforcement 	agencies, 	trauma 	experts, 	government 	officials 	and 	other
professionals 	have 	worked 	together 	to 	educate 	motorists 	of 	the 	risks 	involved
with 	aggressive 	driving, 	and 	to 	stigmatize 	aggressive 	driving 	behavior 	on 	our
roads.

Operation C.A.R.E. 														
Proactive 	enforcement 	efforts 	and 	increased 	police 	visibility 	during 	the 	major
holidays of Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are
the primary purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.). 		
During 	these 	major 	holiday 	periods 	that 	are 	identified 	for 	increased 	highway
travel, the Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to
address 	highway 	safety 	and 		promote 		travel 	safety 	throughout 		the
Commonwealth. 															
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 						
During 	2009, 	each 		of 	the 	Department’s 		seven 	field 	divisions 	continued
enforcement emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within
the 	counties 	in 	their 	divisions. 	Each 	division’s 	program 	focused 	resources 	on
those 	highways 	where 	crashes, 	traffic 	violations, 	and 	citizen 	complaints
regarding 	traffic 	were 	noted. 	The 	objectives 		of 	this 	initiative 	were 	to 	prevent
crashes, 	reduce 	violations, 	and 	address 	the 	concerns 	citizens 	identified 	as
threats to their safety. 														
Virginia State Fair 													
On September 24, 2009, the State Fair of Virginia welcomed visitors to its new
home and surroundings at “The Meadow Event Park” in Caroline County. 		
Relocation from the urban setting in the County of Henrico required that the State
Police assume full responsibility for all safety and security duties associated with
the 	fair, 	its 	vendors, 	the 	exhibitors, 	entertainers, 	thousands 	of 	visitors 	and 	all
traffic management in and around the fair grounds. 							
During the eleven days of the annual event nearly 248,000 visitors attended the
fair 	to 	partake 	of 	the 	art 	and 	crafts, 	the 	competitions, 	the 	displays, 	and 	the
general festivities. Playing host to one-quarter of a million visitors places a high
demand 	on 	services 		and 	available 	resources. 	The 	troopers 	and 	supervisors
devoted 	14,844 	man-hours 	to 	providing 	for 	the 	safety 	and 	the 	security 	of 	fair
attendees. Additionally, there were 479 calls for service made to the State Police
ranging 	in 	nature 	from 	lost 	property, 	missing 	persons, 	medical 	emergencies,
disabled vehicles and suspicious activity, just name a few. 						
Safety Division 														
As of December 31, 2009, there were 4,385 active inspection stations located
throughout 	the 	Commonwealth 	of 	Virginia. 	There 	were 	14,815 	licensed 	safety
inspectors 	who 	performed 	approximately 	7,019,600 	inspections 	at 	appointed
stations 	during 	2009. 		Approximately 	20% 	(1,403,921 	vehicles) 	of 	all 	vehicles
submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 					
This Division investigated 3,208 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,963
instances 	of 	disciplinary 	action 	against 	243 	stations 	for 	various 	classes 	of
offenses and the suspension of 18 inspection stations. These statistics include
																		41
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 42 of 48”
Table: 42
administrative 	errors 	made 	by 	inspection 	stations, 	and 	the 	majority 	of 	errors/
complaints were corrected by counseling sessions. 						
Disciplinary action was also taken against 923 safety inspectors, resulting in 120
suspensions. 														
Safety Division personnel also conducted 1,027 business security checks. 		
Motor Carrier Safety 												
Motor 	Carrier 	Safety 	teams 	ensure 	that 	trucks 	and 	buses 	meet 	all 	safety
requirements 	when 	operating 	on 	Virginia 	highways. 	Troopers 	assigned 	to 	the
Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other
interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations.
They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training academies. 			
Motor 	Carrier 	Safety 	teams 	responded 	to 	39 	hazardous 	material 	spills 	or
incidents 	in 	2009 	and 	conducted 	164 	post-crash 	investigations 	of 	heavy
commercial vehicles involved in accidents. 								
Data indicates that during 2009, Troopers conducted 43,357 in-depth inspections
on heavy commercial vehicles and 7,809 of these, or 18 percent, were placed out
of 	service 	for 	violations 	of 	regulations 	governing 	safety 	equipment 		and
transportation of hazardous materials. 									
Field Support 													
The Safety Division’s sworn employees provided support for local field divisions
during 	all 	major 	C.A.R.E. 	holidays. 	During 	2009, 	Safety 	Division 	troopers 		had
6,189 	arrests/summonses 	issued, 	investigated 	51 	motor 	vehicle 	crashes,
assisted local Troopers with the investigation of 87 motor vehicle crashes, and
assisted 1,975 disabled motorists. 										
Aviation Unit 														
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the
administration 	and 	coordination 		of 	the 	department’s 	aviation 	resources. 		The
Unit’s primary mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement
and 	medical 	evacuation. 	During 		its 	25 	year 	existence, 	the 	Aviation 	Unit 		has
recorded 96,288 flight hours responding to 67,936 flight requests. 				
The unit utilizes three bases located in the following Virginia localities: 			
	1) 	Richmond 													
	2) 	Abingdon 													
	3) 	Lynchburg 													
Aircraft 															
The unit operates six helicopters and three airplanes across Virginia.

	• 	3 Cessna 182 airplanes 													
	• 	4 Bell 407 helicopters 													
	• 	1 American Eurocopter BK117 											
	• 	1 American Eurocopter B0-105 											
The BK117 and BO-105 are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 	
Medical Evacuation 															
The 	Department 	operates 	three 		helicopter 	medical 	evacuation 	programs 	that
serve Central and Southwest Virginia. These programs provide rapid response,
advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients to a
level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the
citizens residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on
April 	1, 		1984, 	and 	responds 	to 	calls 	for 	assistance 	in 	a 	60-mile 		radius 	of
Richmond, 	Virginia. 	Med-Flight 	II 	began 	operations 	on 	January 	1, 	1987 	and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-
Flight 	III 	began 	operations 		on 	September 	1, 	2000, 	and 	responds 	to 	calls 	for
assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and
in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. In 2009, all 3 programs responded to a total of
3,122 requests with 1,126 patients transported. The total number of flights for all
three programs from April 1, 1984 to December 31, 2009 was 26,353 responses
to calls with 16,347 patients transported as a result of these calls. 					
Search and Rescue 															
During 	2009 	the 		Aviation 	Unit 	responded 	to 	246 	requests 	for 	searches 	for
escapees, missing persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward
Looking 		Infra-Red 	system 		on 	four 	helicopters 	and 	a 	30 	million-candlepower
searchlight 	on 	the 	other 	helicopters, 	the 	Unit 	has 	been 	successful 		in 	locating
fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. 	During this period the Unit also
recovered 	$75,000 	in 	stolen 	property, 	and 	1 	missing 	aircraft. 	As 		a 	result, 	5
arrests were made. 																
Surveillance 																	
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2009, the Unit
was 	requested 	7 	times 	for 	drug 	or 	narcotic 	surveillance, 	11 	times 		for 	other
criminal matters and 24 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 1968 marijuana plants
were located at a value of $1,968,000. 											
Other Duties 																	
The 	Aviation 	Unit 	provides 		aerial 	support 	to 	any 	Federal, 	State, 	or 		municipal
agency whereby the solution of a police problem or mission may be obtained.
During 	2009, 	the 	Unit 	provided 		aerial 	support 	to 	61 	requests 	from 		agencies

external to the Department of State Police. These flights included photographing
crime 	scenes, 	providing 	support 	for 	presidential 	motorcades, 		participating 	in
multi-agency 	task 	force 	efforts, 	and 	demonstrations 		of 	the 	capabilities 	of 	the
Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, the
Aviation Unit flew 2,538 hours responding to 3,122 flight requests. 				
Motorist Assistance Program 												
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the department currently operates
in the four largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake,
Fairfax, Richmond, and in the Roanoke/Salem areas. 								
During 	2009, 	motorist 		assistance 	aides 	provided 	assistance 		to 	disabled 	or
stranded motorist on more than 48,534 occasions. 									
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires,
providing 		gasoline, 	jump-starting 	vehicles, 	traffic 		control, 	and 		making 	cellular
phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family members of a stranded
motorist's 	situation. 	Motorist 	Assistance 	Aides 	also 		were 	instrumental 	in 	the
arrest 	of 	drunk 	drivers 	and 	aggressive 	drivers 	by 	reporting 	erratic 		driving
behavior to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension. 					
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 										
The 	Department 	has 	55 	Commercial 	Vehicle 	Enforcement 		Officers 		whose
primary responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial
vehicles 		that 	utilize 	the 	highways 	of 	the 	Commonwealth. 	During 	2009,
approximately 	18 	million 	commercial 	vehicles 	passed 	through 	Virginia's 	13
permanent 	weigh 	stations 	for 	inspection. 	Through 		the 	inspection 	of 	these
vehicles 		and 	through 		other 	enforcement 		initiatives, 	Commercial 	Vehicle
Enforcement Officers issued 49,553 summonses and made 186 criminal arrests.
This 	program 	is 	vital 	to 	Virginia's 	overall 	highway 	safety 	program 	through 	the
protection 	of 	roadways 	from 	overweight 	and 		oversized 	vehicles; 	through
assurances 	that 		commercial 	vehicles 	are 	mechanically 	safe 	to 	operate 		on 	the
highways; 	and 	through 	the 	validation 	of 	all 	commercial 	vehicle 	operators 	to
ensure 	they 	are 	properly 	licensed 	to 	operate 	a 	commercial 		vehicles 	in 	the
Commonwealth.

Crime Prevention 														
During 	2009, 	the 		Department 	provided 		specialized 	training 	to 	the 	Crime
Prevention 	Specialist 	troopers 	on 	current 	crime 	prevention 		trends 	and
techniques. 	Participating 	troopers 	received 	training 	to 	enhance 	their 	ability 	in
protecting governmental, business, and residential security through the "Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model and other mitigation
based methodologies. Additional training focused on personal safety, workplace
violence prevention and personal information associated crimes. All training was
part 	of 	an 	intensified 	crime 	prevention 	curriculum 	that 	enabled 		troopers 	to
achieve 	certification 	or 	remain 	certified 	through 		the 	Department 		of 	Criminal
Justice Services as Crime Prevention Specialist. 								
In 2009, approximately 124,000 citizens of Virginia and visitors were contacted
through 2,388 various crime prevention and safety programs. These programs
allowed 	distribution 	of 	nearly 		45,000 	informational 	handouts 	and 	brochures.
Crime Prevention Troopers conducted 336 crime prevention programs and 708
Traffic Safety Programs. In addition, 108 programs were conducted to address
personal 	safety, 	28 	addressed 	the 	issues 	of 	road 	rage, 	7 	workplace 	violence
workshops 	were 	held, 	and 	12 	programs 	were 	sponsored 	on 	recognizing 	and
preventing schemes and scams. 												
Crime 	prevention 	troopers 	also 	conducted 	security 	assessments 	on 	611
businesses 	and 	residences. 	Additionally, 	during 	2009, 	troopers 	conducted 	38
drug education programs, 7 class action programs, and 11 Help eliminate Auto
Theft (H.E.A.T.) programs to enhance safety in Virginia communities. 			
Below is a summary of significant crime prevention programs / activities for 2009:
	• 	To 	better 	assist 	state 		agencies 	with 	improving 	security, 	the 	Office 	of
		Commonwealth 	Preparedness 		conducted 	its 	annual 	Agency
		Preparedness Assessment. This year the Department was requested to
		submit 	guidance 	materials 	in 	order 	to 	assist 	state 	agencies 	with
		complying with accepted or proven best practices. 						
	• 	The Virginia Judicial Security Initiative, which was initiated in 2005, has
		continued to require assets from the crime prevention program. These
		assets 	involved 	the 	participation 	in 	courthouse 	assessments, 	training
		and 	technical/subject 		mater 		expertise. 	The 	department’s 	crime
		prevention specialists, of which 27 are trained for this specialized form of
		assessment, 	have 	been 	directly 		involved 	in 	the 	assessment 	of 	69
		courthouses 	across 	Virginia. 	The 		program 	and 	its 	product 	have 	been
		recognized by several jurisdictions outside of Virginia and have adopted
		the program as their model. 											
	• 	The Virginia Department of Aviation, in conjunction with the Department
		began 	addressing 	the 	security 	issues 	facing 	Virginia’s 		59 	General
		Aviation 	airports. 	In 	response, 	28 	crime 		prevention 	troopers 	received
																			45
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 46 of 48”
Table: 46
		specific 	training 	needed 		to 	conduct 	comprehensive 		security
		assessments 	on 	these 		airports. 	In 	2009, 		the 	program 	provided
		independent 	assessments 	for 	18 	General 	Aviation 	airports 	across 	the
		state. These assessments are not only providing recommendations to
		the individual airports on methods to enhance security, but are gathering
		information which the Department of Aviation utilizes in projecting future
		security needs. 												
	• 	The Department has continued to disseminate gun locks to the public
		and governmental agencies. During 2009, approximately 12,000 locks
		were 	distributed 	through 		public 	speaking 		events, 	county 	fairs, 	local
		public safety agencies, and the state fair of Virginia. The locks are still
		being provided to localities as requested. 							
	• 	The Crime Prevention Program began certification of 9 new troopers to
		the 	program 	to 	account 	for 	promotions 	at 	the 	area 	office 	level. 	They
		should receive their certifications in late 2010. 						
The Department is represented by Crime Prevention Specialists on the following
committees 	and 	events; 	The 	Governors 	Office 	Prevention 	First/KidSafe
Conference, 	Youth 	Alcohol 	Drug 	Abuse 	Project 	(YADAP), 	the 	Virginia 	Airport
Security Committee, the Virginia Judicial Security Initiative, the Capitol Security
Working Group, Office of the Attorney General’s Seniors and Law Enforcement
Together 	(SALT), 	Governors 	Office 	Substance 	Abuse 	Prevention 	(GOSAP)
committee, and Virginia Crime Prevention Association.
