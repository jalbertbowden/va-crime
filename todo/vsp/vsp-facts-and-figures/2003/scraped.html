	2003 Facts and Figures 	
THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF STATE POLICE
	SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 	
The Superintendent, with the rank of Colonel, is appointed by the Governor and serves as agency head of the
Virginia Department of State Police. In August 2003, Governor Mark R. Warner appointed Lieutenant Colonel
W. Steve Flaherty to replace Colonel W. Gerald Massengill as the next Superintendent of State Police, upon
Massengills’ retirement October 1, 2003. 	
The Department is divided primarily into three Bureaus: Administrative and Support Services, Criminal
Investigation, and Field Operations. The Superintendent’s Office includes the Executive Protective Unit,
Planning and Research Unit, Professional Standards Unit, and the Public Affairs Unit.
The directors of the three Bureaus report directly to the Deputy Superintendent. 	Also reporting to the Deputy
Superintendent is the Executive Protective Unit, Professional Standards Unit, and the Public Affairs Unit.
Professional Standards Unit 	
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs, internal audit, and staff inspection
functions within the Department of State Police. 	
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations of misconduct on the
part of Department employees. 	During 2003, 781 internal investigations were processed.
The Internal Audit Section provides the Department with independent and objective audits and reviews of
Department operations. During 2003, the section provided 13 comprehensive audits of operating sections
within the Department. 	The reports included recommendations for strengthening internal controls.
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components within the Department.
Nine staff inspections were conducted in 2003. 	
Public Affairs Unit 		
The Public Affairs Unit (PAU) maintains daily contact with the public and media, disseminates news releases
about Department programs and activities, develops and implements public awareness programs, and
answers questions on many topics. Personnel in this unit often respond to the scenes of major highway and
criminal incidents to assist the media in providing information to the public. The staff includes the director of
public affairs and a public relations specialist at Administrative Headquarters, and seven public relations
coordinators deployed in field division headquarters in Richmond, Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville,
Chesapeake, Salem, and Fairfax. 	
Public and media relations, information and education are important elements of the Public Affairs Unit.

During 2003, the Unit monitored 20 grants that provided approximately $31.3 million in funding for agency
projects, including the administration of a $13.9 million grant for counter-terrorism measures. 	
Accreditation 	
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement services by
demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally accepted standards. Accreditation
requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of the Department’s organization, operations, and
administration. 	
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the nation to be
accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), Inc. 	In 1991, 1996,
and again in 2001, the Department achieved reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review by
CALEA assessors of the agency’s policies, procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an
on-going project for all accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic
updating of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement
		2

Table: 3
accreditation standards. In 2004, a team of CALEA assessors will conduct an on-site reaccreditation
inspection of the Department’s operations, policies, and procedures to ensure compliance with the standards
of accreditation. 	
	BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATIVE
	AND SUPPORT SERVICES
The Bureau of Administrative and Support Services is comprised of most of the Department’s non-sworn
personnel as well as some sworn employees. The Bureau includes the Divisions of Communications,
Statewide Agencies Radio System, Criminal Justice Information Services, Data Processing, Personnel,
Planning and Research Unit, Property and Finance, and Training.
Employees in these areas provide the Department, especially troopers and special agents in the field, with
essential services through their extensive technical and professional expertise. These services range from:
• 	Purchasing and configuring personal computers ... to designing complex and sophisticated computerized
	systems to maintain critical criminal files;
• 	Installing police radios and radar units in patrol vehicles ... to designing and implementing a Computer-
	Aided Dispatch System;
• 	Employing a qualified and diversified work force ... to managing an exciting volunteer program;
• 	Managing and maintaining Department buildings and grounds across the State ... to preparing, monitoring,
	and accounting for the Department’s annual budget;
• 	Providing criminal justice agencies with rapid access to local, state and national criminal justice files ... to
	supervising Virginia’s Firearms Transaction Program;
• 	Conducting research into innovative law enforcement techniques and products ... to coordinating the
	Department’s accreditation and grant management programs.
The Bureau also develops and proposes legislation involving traffic safety and criminal statutes, and serves as
liaison during General Assembly sessions for discussion of issues.
Communications Division
The Communications Division is responsible for the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of
telephone, land mobile radio, and microwave radios assigned to the Communications Division. Under the
command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates and maintains land mobile
radios, microwave radios and private telephone networks. The system includes 87 microwave radio sites, 46 of
which also have land mobile radio base stations. This responsibility includes compliance with requirements of
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible for:
• 	Maintaining mobile radios;
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios;
• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals;
• 	Provision of pager, cellular, and wireless data equipment and services
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, obstruction lighting, antennas and emergency power
	plants;
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices;
	3
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 4 of 27”
Table: 4
• 	Installing and maintaining equipment, telephones, and other telecommunications at Administrative 	
	Headquarters; and 		
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for mobile and fixed communications equipment.
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. 	Of the 23 sites considered to be the
backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to digital service. 	Digital microwave equipment
has been procured to provide service to the last two headquarters locations, and to the Eastern Shore. 	Site
leases have been executed and microwave site development is progressing to provide that service. 	
Cooperative development or collocation agreements continue to fund equipment upgrades from analog to
digital microwave systems. 	These collocation and relocation agreements have saved the Department 	
approximately $8.5 million over the past seven years. 	
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Project team to define the
existing network and review plans for the new upgraded State Police Land Mobile Radio Network that will
serve all of the Commonwealth’s state level public safety agencies. 	
The Division has procured and installed almost 400 mobile computer terminals (MCTs) and wireless modems
to be used for messaging and routine checks of drivers’ licenses and vehicle registrations. Currently, new
generation mobile services are being investigated to provide higher capacity and better coverage to a larger
geographic area. 	Additionally, some troopers in the Roanoke area have been equipped with MCTs through a
partnership with the City of Roanoke. 	
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with new copper and fiber
optic service. 	Telephone system upgrades continue as needed at area offices and division headquarters
locations. 			
In addition to mission critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates and supports wireless
communications equipment and services from public networks. 	These services make Department personnel
more accessible and keep them better informed regarding routine and administrative activities. 	The number of
wireless telephones approved and in use has doubled in the past year, and now approaches 1,000 units.
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for special events as they
occur. 	Such activities include communications to support security for visiting dignitaries, as well as routine
events where large groups of spectators gather over short periods of time. 	
All field Division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by The Division of Consolidated 	
Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning forks. In the past year, approximately 250 additional
RADAR units were procured and issued to expand availability and replace older units. 	The present inventory
of active radars is approximately 1,400 units, of which the majority are the newer Eagle units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone and local area network wiring requirements for the Department, as
well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of equipment are being maintained
for six additional agencies. The Division also continues to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio 	
equipment for most of the state’s public safety agencies. The Communications Division has actively 	
participated with the Capital Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN)
activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 	
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 	
The Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program will facilitate the communications of 20 participating
state agencies by upgrading the existing Virginia State Police land mobile and microwave radio networks.
STARS will create an integrated, seamless, statewide, wireless voice and data communications system
designed to meet the needs of these agencies. The system will be shared by agencies engaged in public
safety, protection, and service; and will facilitate interoperability with and between localities at the county and
city level. 	To accomplish this, the program will: increase capacity, upgrade the technology, and enhance
coverage of the land mobile radio network; upgrade the technology of, and create disaster recovery alternate
		4

Table: 5
paths for, the microwave radio network; create a secure statewide Intranet with wireless access; implement
statewide law enforcement mobile data; and facilitate unified call-taking and dispatching for all state-level law
enforcement agencies. Radio communications for the Virginia components of the National Weather Service’s
Integrated Flood Observing and Warning System (IFLOWS) network are also being upgraded as part of this
program. 		
Future procurement phases are expected to expand portable radio coverage where required, extend Intranet
access to the other participating agencies, and implement private 700 MHz radio wideband wireless Intranet
access and mobile data in selected areas. 	Completion for currently planned procurement phases is scheduled
for 2011. 	The subscriber equipment (such as mobile radios, portable radios, vehicular repeater systems, and
mobile computers) will be replaced periodically as necessary and the infrastructure’s technology can be
updated if operationally required. 	Localities and federal organizations can be added as full-time STARS
users/partners when appropriate. 	The STARS Program will provide participating agencies with a cost-effective
systems approach that enables interoperability between federal, local, and Commonwealth government
agencies. 		
The lengthy proposal evaluation and analysis process was completed in 2003. 	Negotiations then occurred
with a draft contract being completed in March 2004. 	This document is currently being refined and reviewed by
management. 		
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all files within the
Department. 	This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction, and archiving of records in accordance
with the Records Retention Schedule. 	The Division also acts as the point-of-contact and liaison with the
Library of Virginia. 	The Division processed and responded to 1,841 subpoenas and 108 Freedom of
Information Act requests in 2003. 		
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 		
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 20,502 investigative reports in 2003.
CCRE automated 1,748 non-computerized criminal records in calendar year 2003, leaving a total of 157,089
misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated. 		
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 	
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts and 124 Adult Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	In 2003, 343,884 records were transmitted, negating
the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions
transmitted, 87,519 or 25.5% were rejected. 	In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was
implemented. 	Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated for missing
arrest fingerprint cards. For 2003, notifications for 75,493 individual charges were generated. The majority of
notifications (65%) were generated because the court did/could not include the Document Control Number
when transmitting their data. The remaining notifications (35%) were generated when the court transmitted the
Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file.
Non-Criminal Justice Name-Search Program 		
The program continues to experience growth, with 339,540 inquiries processed in 2003. 	Due to this growth,
the Non-criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented on February 8, 1996, to effectively address this
demand. 	The NCJI can be accessed through the Department’s web site. 	The NCJI eliminates the requirement
for CCRE staff to receive and process “paper record name-search requests.” 	As of December 31, 2003, there
were 160,649 electronic name-search transmissions received from participants, with an average response time
of 72-hours or less since implementation. 	This method of automation tremendously enhanced customer
service. 		
Mental Health File 		
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to purchase a firearm(s).
Official notifications of individuals in these categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication
	5 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 6 of 27”
Table: 6
of an individual being incompetent, involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. As of December 31,
2003, there were 6,300 mental health records added, bringing the total records on file to 53,603.
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry 		
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 12,244 fingerprint-based registrations received since July 1, 1998.
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by providing personal
descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of certain sex crimes. 	Photographs of
offenders are available, and violent offender registrations are maintained on the Internet. 	There were 124,268
searches conducted against the Registry for employment-licensure purposes in 2003. During 2003, the SOR
verified the address of 21,219 sex offenders, and initiated 3,996 criminal investigations to the field divisions.
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 	
As of December 31, 2003, there were 140,216 offenders on file with commitments received from the
Department Of Corrections, which accounts for 10.69% of the offenders on file. 	The Central Criminal Records
Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status Information on a weekly basis. 	The Criminal Status
Information Interface improved the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional information
with minimal error. 		
The Microfilm Section 		
This section archived 1,448,065 documents during 2003. 	
Photographic Laboratory 		
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responded to requests for photographs, digital images, and
court enlargements. 	Additionally, 142,883 photographic prints, an increase of 4%, were developed for use by
sworn personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases.
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 	
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints, and partial latent fingerprints
recovered from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are located at State Police
Headquarters. The Department and 22 other state and local agencies have access to the system through
terminals located in their respective agencies. 	The newly acquired Global Transaction Controller receives Live
Scan transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS systems for searching
and updates. 	Upon completion of this process, a fingerprint card is produced. This step will be eliminated in
early 2004, with the installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive System, which will enhance our ability in
the storage and retrieval of affected records. 		
Currently, there are 1,505,618 ten-print fingerprint records in file and 69,705 unsolved latent fingerprints in the
database. 	In 2003, there were 1,197 suspects identified as a result of successful latent print searches on the
AFIS system. 		
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest and fingerprint information to
the State Police and the FBI which enhanced our ability to detect aliases and outstanding warrants on
arrestees prior to their release. 		
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 		
Currently, there are 74 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 93 Live Scan units. 	In addition, there are 12 civilian
applicant Live Scan sites utilizing 17 Live Scan Units. 	A total of 18 criminal Live Scan sites are submitting
criminal justice and concealed weapon applicant information via Live Scan. 	
The following is a brief comparison of statistics. The percentages reflect the increase or decrease in 2003.

During 2003, the fingerprint section processed 224,053 criminal arrests, 127,424 applicants and 2,761 sex
offender fingerprint cards. 		
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 		
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based on the results
of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2003, 195,308 firearm transactions were
conducted, which is a 4% increase in transactions conducted during 2002. 	Of these, 2,142 (9% reduction)
were disapproved, and 158 (14% increase) wanted persons were identified with 71 (15% increase) arrests
reported. 	In 2003, as compared to 2002, the State Police requested 860 (1.6% increase) criminal
investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to purchase firearms, of which 611 (71%) were arrested.
Certificates for 261 (19% reduction) multiple handgun purchases were issued authorizing the purchase of more
than one handgun within any 30-day period. 		
Direct Access 		
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun dealer to transfer
firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification number for qualified employees. 	In 2003, 997 (13%
increase) seller identification numbers were issued. 		
The FTC maintains 6,667 (3.5% increase) machine gun registrations. 	Additionally, the FTC maintains the
Criminal Firearms Clearinghouse, a central repository of information regarding all firearms seized, forfeited,
found or otherwise coming into the possession of any law enforcement officer believed that were used in
committing a crime. 	In 2003, 5,088 (7% reduction) reports were made to the Clearinghouse.
The Direct Access Program was successful with statistics indicating the current on-site terminal dealers
handled approximately 32% of the transactions processed through the Firearms Transaction Center (FTC)
during 2003. The FTC will continue to enhance and expand direct access to the program. 	As on-line users
increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and verification processes.
Additional employee time devoted to these processes provide more efficient overall services to the firearm
dealers and gun buying public. 		
Concealed Handgun Permits 		
The State Police entered 33,403 concealed handgun permits into the Virginia Criminal Information Network
(VCIN) in 2003, which is a 14.5% increase of permits processed in 2002. Since July 1, 1995, a total of
236,849 permits were issued as authorized by statute. 	As of December 31, 2003, VCIN contained
approximately 110,232 (3.7% increase) active concealed handgun permits issued by Virginia Circuit Courts.
The State Police provides written notification to the applicable courts in instances where an individual named in
a protective order is also in possession of a concealed handgun permit. In 2003, 55 permits were subsequently
revoked compared to 52 revoked in 2002. The State Police also notifies the issuing court in instances where
the holder of a concealed handgun permit is denied the purchase of a firearm. In 2003, 19 letters of notification
were sent to the court for this purpose, which is a 30% reduction of such notifications sent in 2002.
Uniform Crime Reporting 		
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting
(IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different crime offenses.
During 2003, an additional agency became certified for IBR submission, bringing the total IBR agencies to 271.
	7 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 27”
Table: 8
These agencies represent 97% of the total UCR contributing agencies, and 99% of the total population of
Virginia. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hard copy reports. 	Data is submitted either by diskettes
or via the Internet. 	The diskettes are scanned, copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	The Internet files are
sent through the IBR web site. 	This is a secure system to which only contributing agencies have access.
Twice a week, the submitted files are run through the edit process, which generates an error report for the
agencies to correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database. 	A monthly tape
of Virginia’s data is generated and sent to the FBI for inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United
States. 		
During 2003, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues, interpretation of error
reports and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting procedures, as well as assisting vendors with
reporting issues. 	There are 19 private vendors representing IBR certified agencies. 	Several large agencies
built their own in-house software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly reports are now posted on the IBR web site
rather than having to be mailed to each contributing agency. 	The UCR office responded to approximately ten
requests daily for crime statistics from state agencies, government officials, students, media, and the general
public. 		
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletters, and in the annual report, Crime in Virginia, and
distributed to contributing agencies, Commonwealth’s attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state agencies.
The annual report is available to the public for a nominal fee. The 2002 annual report was published in June
2003. 	The Crime in Virginia report can also be found on the State Police web site. This report contains
reported Group A offenses by each contributing agency in Virginia and Group A and Group B arrests by
counties and cities in Virginia. 	This data is used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and
legislative implementation. 		
The IBR web site went into production in 2002. At the beginning of 2003, 165 agencies were submitting their
monthly data through the Internet. By the end of the year, 211 agencies switched from mailing diskettes to
electronically sending files via the Internet. 	This site provides law enforcement agencies with the convenience
of on-line monthly data submission, receiving timely error notifications and monthly and year-to-date statistical
reports, performing searches and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals and bulletins, and posting inquiries in the
FAQ section. 		
During 2003, there were six law enforcement officers in Virginia who were feloniously killed while performing
their duties. There was one officer feloniously killed in 2002; therefore, the increase from 2002 to 2003 was
500%. 	Six is the largest number of officers feloniously killed since the Agency became the state repository for
the UCR Program in 1975. 	In the broad category of offenses reported in this system, Crimes Against a
Person, Crimes Against Property, and Crimes Against Society, only the category of Crimes Against Society
increased over 2002. 	Each of the offenses in this category (drugs, pornography, gambling, and prostitution
and weapon law violations) increased. 	The only offense, which increased in the Crimes Against a Person
category, was the offense of murder. 	There were 408 murders reported in 2003 compared to 379 in 2002, an
increase of 7.7%. 	Several of the property crimes increased; however, they were lesser crimes in number than
the major property crimes such as robberies, burglaries, larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts. 	The property
crimes showing increases were extortion/blackmail, counterfeiting/forgery, fraud, embezzlement, and stolen
property offenses. 		
The FBI performed a UCR/QAR (Quality Assurance Review) on the state repository and nine local agencies
during 2003. The State Program was commended for its interest in reporting accurate crime data to the
national UCR Program. 	Virginia’s UCR Program met all guidelines for four of the FBI’s requirements and
received recommendations on two of the requirements. 	
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 663 member agencies with 6,307 terminals (an increase of 336 terminals
over the number of terminals in 2002). 	Of these terminals, 2,651 are non-mobile; a 2% increase over 2002.
3,656 terminals are mobile; an increase of 7% from 2002. 	In 2003, VCIN processed approximately
234,462,451 transactions, an increase of 12% over last year’s totals, between NCIC/NLETS member agencies
	8 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 27”
Table: 9
and state computer databases. 	This system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three
seconds. 			
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which is critical to law
enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information relating to wanted persons, missing
persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia information relating to 44,584 wanted
persons, 903 missing persons, and 11,587 stolen vehicles. 	
During the later part of 2003, and early 2004, we disconnected the DataMAXX Cyberlink System and replaced
it with FORCEComm terminals that have image capability. 	The FORCEComm terminals were installed in all
State Police area offices and a few local agencies. 		
Data Processing Division 		
The Data Processing Division operates one of the largest computer centers in state government.
Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment and software provided by IBM,
NEC Corporation, UNISYS Corporation and SUN Micro Systems. The Division operates two separate
computer rooms 24 hours a day. 		
Automated Fingerprint Processing 		
In 2003, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 109 systems in 85 local agencies. 	Seventeen of these
systems are installed in applicant agencies, the rest are in local booking stations. 	
More than 184,900 arrest fingerprints were electronically transmitted to State Police in 2003 from local
agencies. 	This represents 81 percent of the arrest volume in Virginia. Approximately 50 percent of the arrests
received electronically at State Police were processed without human intervention. 	
In 2003, over 126,000 applicant prints were processed through the new automated applicant system, which
reduces the turnaround time from months to days. 	In addition, 17 percent of these applicant requests were
initiated at Live Scan devices and were processed with minimal human intervention. 	
CAD/MIS 			
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid entry and retrieval of data
associated with unit activity and calls for service. The CAD system consists of 15 servers, 42 dispatch
terminals, and over 100 remote access users. A total of 1,095,982 incidents were entered into the CAD system
in 2003. A new CAD/Mobile interface system was installed in March 2003. This new system allows enhanced
data sharing between division CAD systems and allows Mobile users to access the CAD systems from their
vehicles. 	To date approximately 400 mobile users have been trained and are using the mobile software to
access CAD and VCIN. From April 15 through December 31, 2003, 271,953 transactions were processed from
the mobile terminals to CAD with 20,718 incidents created by the mobile users. 	
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) is a database containing all incident and
unit information collected in CAD from March 1999. CAD historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. The
database currently holds in excess of six million records. An Intranet web page allows VSP network users to
create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. The web page also allows user access to
weekly and monthly reports. The MIS database allows the Department to track and access information never
before available, such as average response times, total number of calls, and average workloads.
Current projects include: 		
• 	A real time interface to VDOT traffic systems. 	This will allow for a more timely response of VDOT
	resources and enhanced travel information for the public. 	
• 	An updated CAD end user display, allowing for enhanced dispatch functions, such as point and click
	dispatching. 		
• 	An enhanced VCIN interface. 		
• 	A server equipment upgrade.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) 		
In 2002, the Telecommunications Engineering section of the Division began replacing the Department’s
Internal and External dedicated circuit networks with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This type of network
connection uses the Internet for agencies connecting to State Police and State Police Offices throughout the
State. 	This networking configuration is cost efficient as multiple communications links to an agency can now
be combined to one link. 	In addition, it is secure as the data is encrypted to 128 Bit encryption. Implementation
of the VPN network continued throughout 2003. As of December 2003, 280 sites had a VPN box installed. Of
these sites, 230 had converted their applications to the VPN, and the remaining sites are in process.
Implementation of the VPN network will continue until all agencies communicating with the State Police,
including 105 State Police offices, are using the VPN network. 	The VPN network supports the Virginia
Criminal Information Network (VCIN), the Live Scan Fingerprint System, the Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS), and the Tactical Intelligence Processing System. (TIPS) 	
Network Infrastructure 		
In 2003, conversion of the network infrastructure was begun with the installation of three Nortel 8600 switches.
Several of the State Police networks were converted to these switches in October 2003. 	The remainder of the
internal networks will be converted in early January 2004. 	These three switches provide for redundant pathing
between switches and routers at State Police Headquarters. This eliminates single points of failure for the
network and increases throughput for all processes on the network. 	Once the infrastructure upgrade is
complete, State Police will be able to provide a more stable and higher speed network and be in a better
position for expansion of services as required in the ever-changing law enforcement environment.
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 	
The switch over to our new VCIN system, an IBM model p610, in December 2002, has been a complete
success. 	The VCIN system processed over 234 million transactions for 2003. 	In addition, over 240 agencies
were converted from Frame Relay to Virtual Private Network (VPN). This will allow Virginia to support 128 bit
encryption to satisfy the FBI security requirements for dissemination of information. 	Additionally, no VCIN
hardware failure occurred in 2003 requiring automatic switching to our secondary system.
Disaster Recovery Project - State and Local Emergency Preparedness (SLEP) 	
New computer systems have been acquired through the SLEP grant which will be used to provide Disaster
Recovery for State Police. 	A new Sun Microsystems model 6800 system has been installed at SPHQ and
another Sun system is being installed at a Disaster Recovery site for fail over. 	All applications on the UNISYS
mainframe are being converted to the Sun 6800 system. 	The Sun system will completely replace the
mainframe and it will provide for recovery to the Disaster site in case the SPHQ site is not available for an
extended period. 		
Personnel Division 		
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management, with continued
emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the work force. 	
Recruitment Unit 		
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in 2003 to include a first sergeant, seven full time recruiters and one
part time secretary. 	Refocusing recruitment efforts has enabled the department to concentrate on recruiting
and hiring the most qualified, diverse workforce to meet the demand of the future of policing in our global
communities. 	Specific recruitment strategies were designed and implemented to aid in accomplishing the
goals of the unit. 	With the current pace of the recruitment program, recruiters will give a combined 450
programs at selected sites in 2004 to generate a diverse and qualified applicant pool. 	The following are
current strategies: 		
Recruitment “Lunch Boxes” – These programs are directed at Virginia’s university, college, and community
colleges during the spring and fall semesters. 	Recruiters set up in student unions, dining halls, etc. to
	10 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 11 of 27”
Table: 11
introduce students to career opportunities within the department. 	These programs also foster a positive image
between the student citizens and policing. 	Recruiters conduct three programs per month in their division.
Civic/Women/Minority Organizations – Organizations were identified in each of the Department’s seven field
divisions. 	Each recruiter is required to present three of these programs with one of the three programs
directed at women’s recruitment. 		
Military Recruitment – Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning military personnel.
Virginia has the most military facilities of any state in the nation and the military offers a very diverse candidate
pool. 		
Student Athlete Recruitment – A minimum of two programs per month, during active semesters, at identified
college and or university athlete populations via athletic unions and organizations. 	In addition, recruiters have
identified health clubs and are actively recruiting personnel who attend these facilities. 	One of the two
programs per month must be focused on women’s recruitment. 	
Career Fairs – Career fairs are conducted at various locations throughout the state to included contiguous
jurisdictions. Career fairs are attended on a selective basis. 	
Career Sessions – Career Sessions have been scheduled quarterly throughout the state to present to the
public members of the department and information for those interested in joining. 	The focus of these events is
on the recruitment of minorities and women. 		
Employment Section 		
The Department hired 61 trooper trainees for the 105 th Basic Session that began on January 10, 2003, and 55
trooper trainees for the 106 th Basic Session that began on June 25, 2003. These troopers’ applications were

Emergency Operations Center. 	Planning was also started for the new Fusion Center which will be
incorporated into the new headquarters addition. Construction was also started on the new Staunton Area
Office and property was acquired for the new Clifton Forge (Alleghany County) area office. 	Construction of the
new Clifton Forge area office will start in 2004. 		
In addition to its property and financial management duties, the Division oversees the mailroom and printing
sections, which processed 438,546 pieces of mail during 2003, and prints an average of 6.4 million copies
annually. 	It also manages the garage, which is responsible for equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately
2,100 vehicles. 		
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military Property Program,
which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost, military property, and equipment that is
in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as the point of
contact, and provides as state coordinator. 	The program serves over 250 Virginia law enforcement agencies
and in 2003 the program distributed goods valued over $2.3 million dollars. 	
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day operational control of
the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122 Program”. 	This program allows state
and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic
activities through the federal procurement channels at substantial savings. 	During 2003, over $3,506,143 was
purchased through this program saving the Department $585,647.

BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all criminal matters mandated by
statute and established Department policy through the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is
mandated to investigate any matter referred by the Governor. Additionally, the Attorney General,
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs and Grand Juries may request the Department to
investigate matters, which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of
elected officials when directed by the Governor, Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau consists of the
Divisions of Criminal Intelligence, Drug Enforcement, General Investigations and Insurance Fraud.
Criminal Intelligence Division 	
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document, and disseminate
criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime or terrorism. 	CID is currently composed
of six units and one section – the Analytical unit, Research unit, Field Intelligence unit, Financial Crimes
Intelligence unit, Technical Support unit, Computer Evidence Recovery unit, and the Tactical Intelligence
Processing System (TIPS) section. 	
CID’s Analytical Unit operates the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), which is a repository of
intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law enforcement personnel. 	VCIC’s analysts provide
research and analytical support to criminal justice agencies. The analysts assigned use multiple databases and
are in daily contact with local, state, and federal organizations in order to accomplish their mission.
The two agents assigned to the Research Unit accomplish a wide variety of tasks. They assist the other CID
units with specific research tasks, field investigations including surveillance, Interpol requests, officer safety
issues and the handling of fictitious identifications for undercover personnel. 	
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect and supply
intelligence, including information on current investigations. The agents also routinely use the Domestic
15 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 27”
Table: 16
Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The unit consists of agents that are placed in each of the
Department’s seven divisions. 		
The newest unit of the CID is the Financial Crimes Intelligence Unit. 	The agent and financial analyst assigned
gather intelligence on people and businesses that are suspected of financial crimes with the primary emphasis
on money laundering. 	Once the intelligence reveals possible criminal activity, the case is turned over to a
Bureau of Criminal Investigation Field Office for criminal investigation. 	
In 2003, the Technical Support Unit received 574 requests for service. 	Of those requests 245 were in support
of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal
investigations, which were supported with the installation of audio and video recording equipment. 	The unit
continues to support significant investigations and uses methods and technologies to assist any requesting law
enforcement agency. 	The unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement
agencies, as well as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s attorneys’ offices through installation and
operation of closed circuit television systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	The Hostage/Barricade Unit
program continues to support state and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated
technical equipment. The Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to 9 Hostage/Barricade incident requests.
Department efforts have resulted in receipt of grant money that has benefited the Unit. 	Nearly $2 million was
directly targeted in support of the Unit’s initiatives in 2003. 	
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit provides assistance to local, state and federal law enforcement
agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for computer-related evidence, evidence recovery
through forensic examination and quarterly training classes in computer search and seizure. 	In 2003, the
CERU assisted with 44 investigations involving the seizure of 70 computers and other related equipment.
The TIPS Section is currently working with law enforcement agencies throughout the Commonwealth in order
to provide them with the Tactical Intelligence Processing System that will allow intelligence to be entered,
stored, and shared with all agencies in the system. 	The TIPS Section is also currently working with public
safety agencies statewide to provide them a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that will allow intelligence to be
posted on a six-tiered system. 	The top or first tier of the system will require a Top Secret clearance while the
sixth tier of the system will be able to be viewed by the general public. 	
CID is also responsible for the Terrorism Hotline, Drug Hotline, the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Hotline,
and the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The Terrorism Hotline has received 831 calls since
its inception in 2001. The Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System was established to assess
vulnerabilities and threats related to terrorism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	
Drug Enforcement Division (DED) 		
DED continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws. The Division
remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws.
DED’s mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support personnel in eight
distinct functional areas: 		
• DED Regional Field Offices 		
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 		
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 		
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 		
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 		
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit 		
• Asset Forfeiture 		
DED Regional Field Offices - Seven DED Regional Field Offices perform operational narcotics enforcement
investigations, as well as support special operations (undercover, wire intercept, marijuana eradication)
	16 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 17 of 27”
Table: 17
initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 100 special agents available for enforcement and task
force duties at seven field offices. 		
From Jan. 1, 2003, through Dec. 31, 2003, the field offices participated in 1,028 investigations that yielded
$22,096,909 in seized narcotics, $1,669,492 in seized currency, and 290 persons arrested on 371 felony and
misdemeanor charges. In addition, 576 persons were arrested on 839 felony and misdemeanor charges in
cases where DED assisted other agencies. 	DED also seized 7 vehicles and 103 weapons. 	
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DED participates in 24 state/local multi-jurisdictional task forces,
encompassing 86 local jurisdictions. Twenty-three State Police Special Agents and 122 local officers were
assigned to state/local task forces. 		
During 2003, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 3,624 investigations that accounted for
$10,370,061 in illicit drug seizures, $564,644 in seized U.S. currency, and 1,984 persons arrested on 2,771
charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that resulted in 467 persons arrested on 562
charges. 	These task forces also seized 70 vehicles and 188 weapons. 	
Federal Task Forces – DED participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during 2003. 	Fourteen State
Police Special Agents, as well as officers from local police departments and agents from Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were
assigned. 	The federal joint task forces conducted 47 investigations that accounted for $373,860 in drug
seizures and 4 persons arrested on 25 charges. These task forces also assisted in 50 arrests on 71 charges.
Two vehicles and 3 weapons were seized. 		
Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the
cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for being a major
cash crop. With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local
law enforcement agencies, conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically grown marijuana. 	The
State Police and local law enforcement agencies found 8,981 plants in 290 outdoor plots. There were also
2,438 marijuana plants eradicated in 33 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 203
arrests. 	Seizures included 35 weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at $45,040. Considering
the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not reaching the
streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $11.4 million. 	
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to facilitate and assure
coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Six special agents are assigned to GIANT. 	The five
facets of the GIANT mission are: 		
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and outdoor, with the
eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers as a primary goal of GIANT; 	
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor suspicious activities
of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users;
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the Commonwealth by 	
interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in communication among the
various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and; 	
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum extent possible.
GIANT performed 503 operations during 2003 that resulted in 173 arrests, the seizure of $6,428,591 worth of
narcotics, 46 weapons, 8 vehicles, and $70,740 in U.S. currency.

Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit purposes
continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion predates the massive abuse of other drugs
we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit works with the DEA, the Department of
Health Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies
to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs to illicit purposes. 	
During 2003, the Unit received 766 complaints of diversion activities throughout the Commonwealth. 	In
responses to these complaints, 402 investigations were initiated and the 13 special agents assigned to the Unit
arrested a total of 222 persons on 284 charges. Of the 222 persons arrested, 10 were licensed health care
professionals. 	Four search warrants were executed during the past year. 	
A major educational role of the Unit is teaching local law enforcement officials about the extent of the drug
diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it. This role also included educating
health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and the
importance of self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their individual health care delivery systems. 	During
2003, 17 presentations were conducted for 875 health care professionals, and 6 presentations were conducted
for 570 individuals in law enforcement. 		
General Investigations Division (GID) 	
GID responds to complaints about violations that constitute Class 1, 2 and 3 felonies, investigations are
discretionary. Major emphasis is placed on responding to requests from the Governor, Attorney General,
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Grand Juries, and Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth.
A major priority of the GID is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement agencies. Personnel
are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state in order that adequate response can be
made to any location in a reasonable time. The Division has 147 authorized positions, of which 103 are special
agents assigned to conduct investigations. The remaining 44 positions are supervisors and support personnel.
During 2003, GID conducted 3,333 investigations, of which 1,615 or 48.5 percent of the total were a result of
requests from other enforcement agencies. Special agents made 2,133 arrests. 	
GID headquarters personnel are responsible for the day-to-day coordination of investigations occurring
throughout the state and related administrative matters and for the following: 	
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant is the chief arson investigator and coordinates activities between the
Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other investigative agencies throughout the state. 	Arson investigation
training and assistance are provided when requested by localities. 	During 2003, the chief arson investigator
provided or assisted in providing the following training related to arson investigations and explosive related
matters: 		
. 	Investigators attend a weeklong Arson Investigation School from statewide law enforcement, fire
	services and insurance agencies. 	
. 	Training sessions are conducted exclusively for local fire services departments in the 	
	recognition and detection of incendiary fires. 	
. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling bomb threats, bomb
	scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices. 	
. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and blast characteristics
	for law enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, conferences and academies.
Within the Bureau, there are a number of special agents who have been specifically trained to investigate

Members of the Auto Theft Unit coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft investigators and 	
insurance company special investigative units across the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These meetings are held
to discuss current automobile theft trends, and coordinate enforcement efforts among law enforcement 	
agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide auto theft investigation training to numerous troopers and 	
local law-enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police Academy and regional academies. 		
Two special agents and one trooper-agent are assigned to administer the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.)
Program. 	The H.E.A.T. Program is an insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-414 of
the Code of Virginia. 	The Program was established to create a “hotline” system to receive auto theft related 	
tips from citizens. 	Callers who provide information that leads to the arrest of individuals for auto theft related 	
crimes are eligible for a cash reward of up to $25,000.00. 	Numerous awards have been paid over the past 11
years, including several for $10,000.00. 			
The HEAT Program provides funding in the form of grants to local law-enforcement agencies, funding for 	
enforcement training, prevention initiatives, and public awareness. 	In 2003, $50,000 in enforcement grants 	
and $20,000 in training grants were given to local law enforcement agencies across Virginia. 	This is in addition
to the extensive free motor vehicle theft investigation training and prevention assistance provided. 		
Crime Scene Examination – The Division is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the Division of 	
Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called upon by other State Police employees and by local law 	
enforcement agencies to examine and evaluate evidence at the crime scene. 	In 2003, 216 scenes were 	
examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, arson, burglary, and the numerous other major crimes.

request. During 2003, 636 criminal polygraphs were conducted. 	
Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – During 2003, this office investigated 395 cases which included 203
requests from other agencies. 	A total of 365 arrests were recorded for the year. 	
The Violent Crimes Investigative Unit opened 8 cases for the year; all were requests from other agencies.
Three cases were entered into the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP), which is a national data
base established by the U. S. Department of Justice and maintained by the FBI. 	The Special Agent assigned
to this unit also presented 43 programs relating to homicides, sex crimes and hostage negotiations.
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 44 trained hostage negotiators available for hostage or
barricade situations. 	During 2003 the negotiators trained several times with local law enforcement and State
Police tactical teams. 	They responded to 24 barricaded subject situations. 	
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – This Unit consists of eight High Technology Crimes Special Agents, and
twenty-three Special Agent Accountants. 	The Cyber Crime Agents opened 132 cases in 2003, involving a
variety of investigations for this Department and other local/federal agencies. The special agent accountants
concentrate on the investigations of white-collar 	
Crime and conducted 455 investigations in 2003. 	
Insurance Fraud Division (IFD) 	
Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved establishing an Insurance Fraud Investigative Division
within the Department of State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The purposes of this Unit are threefold:
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the Department has reason to
	believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to
	determine the extent of such insurance fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state and local police,
	other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units, and any other person;
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud that, in its judgment,
	require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations. 	
IFD currently has 19 special agent positions located strategically throughout the state. Their primary focus is
on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2-178, obtaining
money under false pretense. The law now requires that if insurance professionals have reason to believe that
someone is violating or will be violating this statute, they are compelled to disclose this information to the
Department of State Police. Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging
burglaries, fraudulently reporting theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation injuries. The Division is
constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving claim funds from
insurance carriers. 		
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household approximately $200 in
additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services.
This Division is dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of
Virginia. The hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected insurance fraud receives frequent
activity. The toll-free telephone number is: 1-877-62FRAUD. 	
Last year there were 1,413 calls received through the toll free hotline service. A reward program has been
established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of
	20 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 21 of 27”
Table: 21
individuals committing insurance fraud. IFD will operate the reward program by use of the insurance fraud
hotline and through information obtained during investigations and provided by the general public. A reward
committee has been selected to make recommendations based on written policy and procedures. Their
recommendations will be forwarded through channels to the Superintendent for final approval.
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of insurance fraud to the
general public. This electronic reporting system provides the insurance industry and the general public the
capability to report incidents of suspected insurance fraud directly to the Insurance Fraud Division on line. This
service is available through the Department’s and the stampoutfraud.com Internet Web sites. The address is:
www.stampoutfraud.com 						
During 2003, the Insurance Fraud Division received 1,189 notifications of potential property and casualty
insurance fraud from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and the general public. There were 218
criminal investigations initiated resulting in 84 cases being prosecuted, which led to 105 criminal charges being
placed for insurance fraud and related offenses. The courts ordered $1,729,586 in restitution during 2003.
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of claimed
loss that was actually received by individuals submitting suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2003, in
cases handled by the Insurance Fraud Division, more than $2 million was actually collected by individuals
suspected of insurance fraud and the total amount involved in suspicious claims that was attempted, but not
collected, was $7.9 million. 						
Counter Terrorism and Criminal Interdiction Unit 			
This unit was named the Special Operations Division (S.O.D.) when it was established on July 1, 2000 by the
Virginia General Assembly. Since its inception, this unit has undergone numerous transformations.
As the Special Operations Division, its original mission was the interdiction of narcotics on Virginia’s highways,
public transportation systems, as well as in schools and businesses. 	S.O.D. provided outstanding assistance
to local police departments from around the state requesting assistance to augment their resources by
effectively addressing localized drug and firearm-related problems/situations that exceeded their existing
resources. 							
Due to the events of September 11, 2002, the Special Operations Division was reorganized and its name was
changed to Special Operations Unit. Expansions were made to its personnel offices and duties included
responsing to acts of terrorism. 	This unit carried out the Virginia State Police Bureau of Field Operations
(B.F.O.) Homeland Security responsibilities related to response and recovery operations. 	The seven areas
within the unit served to coordinate the response of other resources and were core members of the Statewide
Regional Response Teams. 						
On January 10, 2003, the name of the Unit was changed to the Counter Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit
(C.C.I.). 	C.C.I. became fully staffed and operational in May 2003. 	On August 10, 2003, C.C.I. was transferred
to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). 	To this day, C.C.I. continues its efforts in criminal interdiction
and provides assistance to localities around the state in addition to its Homeland Security responsibilities.
The Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit participated in eight successful City/State Partnerships
during the year 2003. 	The statistics for these partnerships are as follows:

		BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS (BFO) 		
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000 miles of state
roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic
enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the ability of local law 	
enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection
Program, the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations. 		
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police services into
seven field divisions. 	These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or
more cities and/or counties. 	Manpower is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county
level. 							
Safety Division 						
With the implementation of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program in 1932, Virginia embarked upon and has
continued in a leadership role in the promotion of highway safety. 			
As of December 31, 2003, there were 4,189 active inspection stations located throughout the Commonwealth
of Virginia. There were 13,245 licensed safety inspectors who performed approximately 7,277,650 inspections
at appointed stations during 2003. Approximately 19 percent (1,398,450 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for
inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 					
This Division investigated 3,642 inspection complaints, which resulted in 3,315 instances of disciplinary action
against 52 stations for various classes of offenses and the suspension of 28 inspection stations. 	These
statistics include administrative errors made by inspection stations, and the majority of errors/ complaints were
corrected by counseling sessions. 						
			22 				
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 23 of 27”
Table: 23
Disciplinary action was also taken against 880 safety inspectors, resulting in 118 suspensions.
Safety Division personnel conducted 882 business security checks. 	
Motor Carrier Safety 	
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety requirements on Virginia's
highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and
other interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as
instructors in criminal justice training seminars. 	
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 59 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2003, and conducted 230
post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents. 	Data indicates that during 2003
troopers conducted 38,769 in-depth inspections on heavy commercial vehicles and 8,517 of these, or 21.9
percent, were placed out of service for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation
of hazardous materials. 	
Field Support - Safety Division sworn employees provided support for local field divisions during all major
C.A.R.E. holidays. 	During 2003, Safety Division troopers had 3,236 arrests/summonses issued, investigated
48 motor vehicle crashes, assisted local troopers with the investigation of 155 motor vehicle crashes, and
assisted 2,920 disabled motorists. 	
Aviation Unit 		
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the administration and
coordination of the Department’s aviation resources. The Unit operates seven helicopters and four airplanes
from four bases located in Lynchburg, Manassas, Abingdon, and Richmond, Virginia. The Unit’s primary
mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical evacuation. During its’ 20 year
existence the Aviation Unit has recorded 77,000 flight hours responding to 48,332 flight requests. The
Department has four Bell 407 helicopters, an American Eurocopter BK117 and two American Eurocopter B0-
105’s. The BK117 and BO-105’s are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. The Department also
has four Cessna 182 airplanes. 	
Medical Evacuation 	
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve Central and Southwest
Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically
injured patients to a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the citizens
residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to calls for
assistance in a 60-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1, 1987, and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began operations on
September 1, 2000, and responds to calls for assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor
to Danville and in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. In 2003, all 3 programs responded to a total of 1,428 requests
with 919 patients transported. The total number of flights for all three programs from April 1, 1984, to
December 31, 2003, was 14,299 responses to calls, with 10,138 patients transported as a result of these calls.
Search and Rescue 	
During 2003 the Aviation Unit responded to 91 requests for searches for escapees, missing persons, criminals,
and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward Looking Infra-Red system on two helicopters and a 30 million-
candlepower searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has been successful in locating fugitives, missing
persons, and lost children. During this period the Unit also recovered 10 missing vehicles. 	As a result, 8
arrests were made. 		
Surveillance 		
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2003, the Unit was requested 10 times for
drug or narcotic surveillance, 60 times for other criminal matters and 33 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 11
arrests were made and 864 marijuana plants were located at a value of $864,000.00.

Table: 24
Other Duties 		
The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any Federal, State, or municipal agency whereby the solution of a
police problem or mission may be obtained. During 2003, the Unit provided aerial support to 142 agencies
external to the Department of State Police. These flights included photographing crime scenes, providing
support for presidential motorcades, participating in multi-agency task force efforts, and demonstrations of the
capabilities of the Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2003, the Aviation Unit
flew 2,946 hours responding to 2,913 flight requests. 	
Operation Alert 		
Operation Alert is a program especially designed to interdict criminal activity on the highways of Virginia.
Specialized training is provided to troopers to heighten their awareness when engaged in traffic stops and
during public contacts urging the trooper to look for unusual circumstances that typically indicate criminal
conduct and activity. 		
The Department's efforts in Operation Alert during 2003 resulted in troopers making a total of 7,980 Operation
Alert Traffic Stops that resulted in 3,768 arrests and the filing of 3,082 criminal charges. Sworn personnel
removed an estimated $ 5,438,273 worth of narcotics and dangerous drugs from the highways of the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	In addition, troopers seized $169,859 in currency and 130 weapons as a result of
the Department's enforcement effort. 		
Motorist Assistance Program 		
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the Department currently operates in the four largest 	
metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake, Fairfax, Richmond, and the Roanoke/Salem
areas. 	During 2003, motorist assistance aides provided assistance to disabled or stranded motorist on more
than 59,192 occasions. 		
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires, providing gasoline, jump-
starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family
members of a stranded motorist's situation. 	Motorist Assistance Aides also were instrumental in the arrest of
drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting erratic driving behavior to troopers who subsequently made
the apprehension. 		
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 	
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary responsibilities include the
inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. 	During
2003, approximately 11 million commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for
inspection. Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial
Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 80,817 summonses and made 401 criminal arrests. 	This program is vital
to Virginia's overall highway safety program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized
vehicles; through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and
through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a
commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 		
Crime Prevention 		
During 2003, the Department provided specialized training to selected troopers throughout the State in crime
prevention and personal safety. 	Participating troopers received training in "Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design" (CPTED), business security and techniques to promote personal safety. All training
was part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to achieve certification through the
Department of Criminal Justice Services as crime prevention specialists. 	
During 2003, approximately 157,000 citizens of Virginia were contacted through 2,889 various programs
conducted and nearly 80,000 informational handouts were distributed by certified crime prevention troopers.
Troopers conducted 427 crime prevention programs and 813 Safety Programs. In addition 170 programs were
	24 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 25 of 27”
Table: 25
conducted to address personal safety, 52 programs addressed the issues of road rage, 18 workplace violence
workshops were held, and 36 programs were sponsored on recognizing and preventing schemes and scams.
Crime prevention troopers also conducted CPTED assessments on 629 businesses and on 4 residences. 	
Additionally, during 2003, troopers conducted 38 drug education programs, 19 class action programs, and 4 	
HEAT programs to enhance safety in Virginia communities. 			
The Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) Program 			
Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is a validated, copyrighted, comprehensive drug and violence 	
prevention education program for children in Kindergarten through 12th grade. 	D.A.R.E. is a cooperative effort
of the Virginia State Police, the Virginia Department of Education, local law enforcement agencies, and school
divisions. 	D.A.R.E. is taught in 126 of Virginia’s 134 school divisions. 			
The D.A.R.E. lessons focus on four major areas: 			
• 	Providing accurate information about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs 			
• 	Teaching students decision making skills 			
• 	Showing students how to resist peer pressure 			
• 	Giving students ideas for alternatives to drug use 			
During the 2002-2003, school year, visitation lessons were presented to 123,908 Elementary students in 	
grades K - 4. 	The D.A.R.E. Core Program (grades 5 to 6) was presented to 65,300 students. 	The 		
Middle/Junior High School Program (grades 7 to 8) was provided to 17,192 students. 	The High School 		
Program (grades 9 to 10) was delivered to 5,520 students. 			
In February 2001, D.A.R.E. America in conjunction with the University of Akron received a grant from the 	
Robert Woods Johnson Foundation in Princeton, NJ. The purpose of this grant was to re-write the 		
Middle/Junior High curriculum, as well as conduct a five-year study and evaluation of the effectiveness of the
new material. 				
The re-writing of the Middle/Junior High curriculum has been completed, and the new curriculum reflects 		
changes in both content and delivery style, similar to the revisions made to the elementary curriculum. 	The 	
delivery style shifted from instructional to a more “hands on” approach, and the initial response to the changes
has been extremely positive. 				
The core D.A.R.E. (5 th/6 th Grade) curriculum was re-written in 2003 by the University of Akron and D.A.R.E. 	
America. 	This revised curriculum also concentrates on facilitation, and like the revised curriculums for 		
elementary and Middle/Junior High it will also be very activity based in its delivery. 			
During the 2003-2004 School year, law enforcement agencies and school systems may choose to teach the 	
current curriculum or the revised. 	Starting in the 2004-2005 school year, all agencies must deliver the revised
curriculum. 				
Virginia D.A.R.E. Training Center 			
The Virginia State D.A.R.E. Training Center was established as a cooperative effort between the Virginia State
Police, the Virginia Department of Education and D.A.R.E. America. 	This center was established to provide 	
the standardized training of D.A.R.E. officers in Virginia and to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. program. 	A
unique feature of the D.A.R.E. Program is the use of uniformed police officers as instructors. 			
The Virginia State D.A.R.E. Training Center is in the process of re-training all current D.A.R.E. officers in the 	
new curriculum, and all future training seminars will utilize the updated material. 			
In the 2002-2003 reporting period, Virginia has sponsored fifteen seminars for 658 officers. 	The Virginia State
D.A.R.E. Training Center held two D.A.R.E. Officer Training Seminars. 	In addition to these training seminars,
the Virginia State D.A.R.E. Training Center conducted nine Facilitation Trainings and three Curriculum

Updates. 	These training sessions were presented to update officers on the revised curriculum and delivery
methodology. 	Additionally, the Virginia State D.A.R.E. Training Center, in conjunction with the Center for
School Safety and the Virginia D.A.R.E. Officers Association, presented a two-day in-service in Portsmouth,
Virginia. 		
Specialty Teams 		
Each of the seven field divisions deploys tactical teams, canine teams and SCUBA teams. 	These teams are
available 24 hours a day to assist local law enforcement agencies or State Police personnel. 	Tactical teams
assist in the execution of high-risk search or arrest warrants and in dealing with hostage situations. 	Canine
teams are available to track lost persons or fugitives, search for suspects of crimes, and detect illegal drugs or
explosives. SCUBA teams are used to recover drowning victims or evidence of criminal activity. 	
Canine Program 		
In 2003, Patrol Canine Teams responded to 283 requests of which 78 were from Department personnel and
195 were from other state and local law enforcement agencies. 	These requests resulted in 69 felony and 17
misdemeanor arrests. They also conducted 18 canine demonstrations. 	
Additionally, the Department's Explosive/Weapons Detector Canine Teams responded to 922 searches, 351
security assignments and conducted 68 demonstrations. 	These calls resulted in the recovery of two explosive

The Accelerant Detector Canine Team responded to 25 requests of which 17 were from the Department and
eight from other State and Federal law enforcement agencies. 	The teams had 3 alerts to accelerants at the
scenes of arson investigations. 		
Tactical Team Program 		
Within each of the seven State Police field divisions, a Tactical Operation Team is maintained. 	These teams
are available to assist local agencies and other State Police members in the arrest and apprehension of
individuals known to pose a threat to law enforcement officials and in other situations where there is a risk to
police officer safety. 	During 2003, State Police Tactical Teams responded to 251 requests for assistance.
Tactical Team personnel made a total of 228 arrests resulting in 228 felony charges, 64 misdemeanor charges,
