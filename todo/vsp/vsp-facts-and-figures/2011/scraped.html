	THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF STATE POLICE 	
			ANNUAL REPORT 				
		2011 FACTS AND FIGURES 				
		SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 				
The Virginia Department of State Police is divided primarily into three Bureaus:
Administrative and Support Services, Criminal Investigation, and Field Operations. 	
Each Bureau Director, who holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, reports directly to the
Deputy Superintendent. 										
The 	Superintendent’s 	Office 	includes 	the 	Executive 	Protective 	Unit, 	Professional
Standards Unit, the Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls, and the
Public Relations Office. 										
Professional Standards Unit 									
The 	Professional 	Standards 	Unit 	is 	responsible 	for 	the 	internal 	affairs 	and 	staff
inspection functions within the Department of State Police. 				
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations
of 	misconduct on the part of 	Department employees. During 2011, 451 internal
investigations were processed. 									
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components
within the Department, ensuring compliance with National Accreditation Standards,
OSHA requirements, and Department policies and procedures. 	Six staff inspections
were conducted in 2011. 	The Staff Inspection Section also manages all records
retention and destruction within the Department. 						
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 2 of 42”
Table: 2
Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls 			
Established in March 2007, the Office of Performance Management and Internal
Controls 	(OPMIC) 	was 	created 	to 	track 	and monitor 	progress 	on 	the 	objectives
established in the Virginia Performs performance management system and to ensure
compliance 	with 	standards 	developed 	by 	central 	government 	oversight 	agencies.
OPMIC is also tasked with managing Agency Risk Management and Internal Control
Standards for the Department. 	OPMIC is comprised of the Internal Audit Section and
the Planning and Research Section. 						
Internal Audit Section 								
Internal Audit performs audits and reviews of Virginia State Police operations for the
purpose of monitoring the agency’s performance in maximizing the efficiency and
effectiveness of Department operations and strengthening internal controls. Internal
auditors follow professional auditing standards and carry out the scope of their work in
an independent and objective manner. Results of all internal audits are reported to
management 	and 	the 	Superintendent, 	along 	with 	relevant 	recommendations 	for
improvement. Some of the common types of internal audits include: 			
• 	Review of the reliability of financial data and related financial reporting of 	
	operations 									
• 	Review of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures 	
• 	Audits of various operational areas or programs within the Department 	
• 	Reviews of the safeguarding of assets and the prevention/detection of losses, 	
	errors, or irregularities 								
• 	Audits of information technology systems and related security of data 	
• 	Investigations of State Employee Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Hotline complaint 	
	referrals 									
• 	Review or testing of the Department’s compliance with the Agency Risk 	
	Management and Internal Controls Standards (ARMICS) 			
Planning and Research 								
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all
divisions and units of the Department and is responsible for: 			
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies 	
• 	Updating staffing formulas 							
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs 	
• 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies 			
• 	Maintaining the State Police Manual 					
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s performance, productivity and

• 	Conducting the annual Citizen Survey 				
During 2011, the Planning and Research Section administered 39 grants that provided
approximately $11.7 million in funding for agency projects. 			
Accreditation 							
In August 2010, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by the
Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The Department
was fully compliant with the accreditation standards and received many favorable
reviews from the public input component of the evaluation. 			
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA, as the
Department, in 1985, became the second state law-enforcement agency in the nation to
receive official accreditation by CALEA. 				
Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for all accredited law enforcement
agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of policies and
procedures 	to 	ensure 	compliance 	with 	internationally 	accepted 	law 	enforcement
standards. In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven agencies awarded a
Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully maintaining accredited status for
over 15 years. 							
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement
services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally
accepted standards. Accreditation requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of
the Department’s organization, operations, and administration. 		
Public Relations Office 						
The Public Relations Office (PRO) is responsible for planning, developing, managing
and implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations information and
educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to maintaining daily
contact 	with 	the public 	and media, 	the PRO 	disseminates news 	releases about
Department programs and activities, traffic safety enforcement, and crime prevention.
The office also develops and implements highway safety and public awareness media
campaigns and conducts press interviews around the state. 		
The PRO staff consists of a Public Relations Manager and two Public Relations
Coordinators at State Police Administrative Headquarters. The Public Relations Office
assists and supports the Department’s Public Information Officers (PIO) assigned to
four of the seven field divisions. PIO’s respond to the scenes of major highway crashes,

	Management Information System (MIS) / Mobile Switch System (MSS) / STARS
	Data Systems 									
• 	Serving on the Statewide Interdepartmental Radio System (SIRS) Board, and the
	Virginia Statewide Interoperability Executive Committee (SIEC) 			
The Division provides engineering, maintenance, inventory control, asset management,
configuration management, and operations support services for the STARS Network.
The Division also supports the land mobile radio, mobile data and legacy radio systems of
the 	Commonwealth’s 	21 	STARS 	participating 	state-level 	public 	safety 	and 	service
agencies. 	The STARS Network is supported 24/7 by the STARS Network Operations
Center (NOC). 										
The STARS project provides a private data network with statewide geographical coverage
allowing units to operate mobile computer terminals through the radio. 	Mobile data use
has now been expanded to the entire state with supplemental wireless data throughout all
divisions. 											
The 	Communications 	Division 	provides 	design, 	engineering, 	maintenance, 	and
technical 	support 	for 	the 	Commonwealth 	Link 	to 	Interoperable 	Communications
(COMLINC) 	project 	that 	consolidated 	the 	efforts 	of 	several 	regions 	of 	the
Commonwealth to provide interoperability between the Virginia State Police and with
and among localities and other state and federal agencies. The hardware and software
has been purchased through federal grants. 							
											6
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 7 of 42”
Table: 7
In order to solidify these various projects an engineer was funded and all maintenance
and 	administration 	was 	assumed 	by 	the 	Communications 	Division. 	The 	project
currently encompasses 108 of 134 localities and a number of state and federal
agencies. Discussions with other regions are ongoing. 						
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid entry
and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The CAD system
consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote access users. A real
time data feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate rapid response to incidents
impacting traffic. 											
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) is a database
containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD since March 1999. 	CAD
historical data is transferred to MIS every two hours. 						
The database currently holds in excess of 12,000,000 records. 	In 2011, 865,631
incidents were recorded in the CAD systems. An Intranet Web page allows VSP network
users to create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. 	An Intranet
Web site allows users to view real time CAD incidents. 	The MIS database allows the
Department to track and access information never before available, such as average
response times, and total number of calls. 							
The Mobile Management System provides support for over 2,500 vehicle terminals
currently deployed. The users supported include troopers, other state agencies, and local
sheriffs’ offices and police departments. 	This system allows user access to VCIN/NCIC,
text messaging, and for the troopers, full CAD functionality. 					
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with
new copper and fiber optic cable service. Telephone system upgrades are continuing as
needed at area offices and division headquarters statewide. 					
In addition to mission-critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates
and supports wireless communications equipment and services. 	The Division constantly
monitors wireless services to provide better coverage and increased technical support.
This effort supports the current mandated budget reductions with significant savings to
the Department of State Police and the taxpayers in the Commonwealth. These services
make Department personnel more accessible and keep them better informed regarding
routine and administrative activities. The number of wireless telephones approved and in
use has been reduced to a little over 900 units in support of recent budget reductions.
Current 	cellular 	services 	are 	allowing 	the 	elimination 	of 	pagers 	in 	most 	areas 	of
operations as the wireless carriers build out the more rural areas. 					
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for
special events as they occur. 									
2011 events included:

Table: 8
1. Communications support for the NASCAR races held twice a year at Richmond 	
	International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway 					
2. Floydfest Musical Festival 									
3. Numerous local festivals and events requiring security and traffic control services,
	including the NHRA Races; Urbanna Oyster Festival; Strawberry Hill, Foxfield, 	
	Gold Cup races; Galax Fiddler’s Convention; various tactical operations 		
4. Security and traffic control for the Virginia State Fair in Caroline County 		
All field division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by the Division of
Consolidated Laboratories for the purpose of calibrating 2,869 RADAR tuning forks. 	
The present inventory of active RADARS is approximately 1,440 units and 331 LIDAR
units. The majority of the Department RADARS are the newer Golden Eagle II units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone services and local area network wiring for the
Department and other state agencies. 	The Division currently maintains approximately
21,500 items of radio equipment for the state’s public service and public safety agencies.
The Division will be responsible for over 60,000 items of STARS equipment once the
network is fully implemented. Depot level repair will be performed in the Communications
Division, a great savings over all other alternatives. 						
The 	Communications 	Division 	has 	actively 	participated 	with 	the 	Capital Wireless
Interoperability 	Network 	(CAPWIN) 	and 	SAFECOM 	(formerly 	PSWN) 	activities 	to
improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 			
The 	Communications 	Division 	serves 		as 	Virginia’s 	Frequency 	Advisor 	for 	the
Association 	of 	Public-Safety 	Communications 	Officials 	(APCO), 	the 	Federal
Communications Commission’s designated agent. The duties include: 			
• 	Preparation of new and modified FCC license applications for localities and 	
	agencies throughout the Commonwealth as requested 					
• 	Coordinate applications processed through APCO headquarters with regards to 	
	spectrum efficiency, coverage needs, protection of Commonwealth incumbents 	
	and conformance to regulations 								
• 	Review to accept, deny or comment on applications processed through other 	
	coordinating agencies for protection of Commonwealth incumbents and 		
	conformance to regulations

Criminal Justice Information Services Division 				
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of
all 	files 	within 	the 	Department. 	This 	includes 	the 	implementation, 	monitoring,
destruction, and archiving of records in accordance with the State Police Records
Retention Schedule. 							
In 2011, the Division processed and responded to 4,158 subpoenas and 393 Freedom
of Information Act requests. 							
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 					
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 232,330 criminal
investigative reports in 2011, a decrease of 15% from 2010. 		
In 2011, the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) received 1,679 Notifications of
Suspected Alien Reporting forms from Virginia probation and parole officers subsequent
to convictions in circuit courts or referrals to probation or parole officers or for probation
supervision, pursuant to Section 19.2-294.2, Code of Virginia. 		
In 2011, the CCRE completed 3,445 expungements of police and court records, 308
more than in 2010, which represents an increase of 9%. 				
In 2011, the CCRE responded to and completed 185 challenges by citizens to the
existence or accuracy of their criminal history record. The 2010 total was 171.
In 2011, the CCRE received 8,131 legal name change court orders, a process that
requires the querying of the Computerized Criminal History (CCH) Name File in order to
determine the existence of a criminal history record, and if determined, results in the
addition of the court-ordered name change to the CCH Name File, archival of the court
order, and notification to the FBI to add the new name. 	Criminal history records were
identified for 1,904 of the total name changes received. 				
In 2011, the CCRE generated 880 Concealed Handgun Permit court notification letters,
a decrease of 99, since 2010. The notifications are routinely made to the circuit court
that issued the permit, the court where the case was or will be adjudicated, with a copy
forwarded to the commonwealth attorney of the jurisdiction that issued the permit and
the commonwealth attorney of the jurisdiction of the adjudicating court. 	
In 2011, the CCRE processed 23,523 adult and juvenile fingerprint cards including the
National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) card scanning equipment to scan the
mug shot, data entered demographics from the print cards into the CCH file and scan
the fingerprint card bar code. The total for 2010 was 25,388. 		
Non-Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) 					
The 	Non-Criminal 	Justice 	Section 	processed 	a 	total 	of 	84,892 	fingerprint-based
searches and 236,759 name search requests for 2011. On February 8, 1996, the Non-
Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant growth and
										9
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 10 of 42”
Table: 10
demand for criminal history record requests. 	This interface eliminates the requirement
for CCRE staff to receive and process a high volume of “paper record name-search”
requests. 							
In, 2011, CCRE staff processed 114,534 paper inquiries or 48.4% and 122,225 or
51.6% electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average
response time of 72 hours or less. 	Of the total paper record name search requests,
64,488 or 56.3% inquiries were submitted on the bar-coded criminal history request
forms and the remaining 50,046 or 43.7% were submitted on the non bar-coded forms.
The bar code method of automation has tremendously enhanced customer service by
reducing turnaround time. 					
Mental Health File 						
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to
purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these categories are
received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual (1) acquitted by
reason of insanity, (2) involuntarily admitted to inpatient or outpatient treatment, (3)
adjudicated mentally incapacitated or incompetent, or (4) is the subject of a temporary
detention order (TDO) and agreed to voluntary admission. 	As of December 31, 2011,
there were 18,811 mental health records added bringing the total records on file to
164,877. These figures are based on the new GRI (Global Recording Interface) Report,
which captures information in real time and has replaced the older reporting process. In
2011, the CCRE received 46 notifications of restoration of capacity or right to purchase,
possess or transport a firearm. Reviewing this file when an application to purchase is
being processed has prevented the transfer of a firearm in 235 instances in 2011.
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 	
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for
employment-licensure purposes has increased. 			
 	The SOR experienced a 10.3% increase. 			
 	In 2011, there were 173,668 searches. 			
 	An increase of 17,942 searches compared to 2010. 		
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by
providing personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of
certain sex crimes. 	Information regarding registered offenders which includes a
photograph is maintained on the internet. 				
The 	Sex 	Offender 	Registry 	(SOR) 	includes 	23,041 	fingerprint-based 	registrations
received since July 1, 1997. 					
 	Fingerprint registrations grew 7% from 2010 to 2011. 		
								10
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 11 of 42”
Table: 11
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit 							
The 	Sex 	Offender 	Investigative 	Unit 	conducts 	criminal 	investigations 	related 	to
offenders required to register. 	In 2011, 2,474 criminal investigations were initiated,
which is a 1.3% decrease from 2010. 							
The Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual offenders. 	Registered offenders
require semi-annual address verification and an additional verification within 30 days of
a change to their home or employment address information. 					
During 2011, troopers confirmed 17,815 addresses which represent a 4.0% increase in
verifications from 2010. 									
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 					
The Interface consists of 123 Circuit Courts, 132 General District Courts, and 124
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	
In 2011, an estimated 444,144 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to
submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions
transmitted, an estimated 4.6% were rejected. 							
In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented. Designed
to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated for missing
arrest fingerprint cards. 									
For 2011, notifications to law enforcement agencies for 1,046 individual charges were
generated. 	The notifications were generated because the court did/could not include
the 	Document 	Control 	Number 	when 	transmitting 	their 	data 	or 	when 	the 	court
transmitted the Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding
fingerprint card on file. 									
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 						
As of December 31, 2011, there were 200,127 offenders on file with commitments
received from the Virginia Department of Corrections, which accounts for 9.7% of the
total records maintained in the CCRE. 							
The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information Interface improved
the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional information with
minimal error. 										
The Microfilm Section 									
This 	section 	archived 	778,810 	documents 	during 	2011, 	an 	increase 	of 	23,061
documents, or 3% since 2010. 									
Photographic Laboratory 									
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for photographs,
digital images, and court enlargements. 	In 2011, there were 138,685 photographic
											11
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 12 of 42”
Table: 12
prints, an increase of 11,866, developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations
and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases in 2011. 	The lab also
received and processed 278 compact discs (CD) a decrease 25%. 	This decrease is
due to the Digital Crime Scene Images (DCSI) increased usage by the agents and
troopers. 											
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 				
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and palm prints
from criminal arrests, sex offenders and partial latent fingerprints recovered from crime
scenes. 	The 	central 	components 	of 	this 	system 	are 	located 	at 	State 	Police
Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state and local agencies
have access to the system through terminals located in their respective agencies. The
Global 	Transaction 	Controller 	receives 	Live 	Scan 	transmissions 	and 	provides
automated interfaces to CCH, Sex Offender Registry (SOR), Consolidated Applicant
Tracking System (CATS), and AFIS systems for searching existing criminal history
records or to match latent fingerprints against known criminal prints. The installation of
the Electronic Fingerprint Archive System has enhanced our ability to store and retrieve
these records. 	Currently there are 2,094,900 Virginia unique subject-related fingerprint
files as part of AFIS. 	Additionally, there are 121,837 unsolved latent fingerprints and
5,675 unsolved palm prints in the database. 	The Slap database has 886,750 images;
the Palm database has 171,000 images. 							
During 2011, the fingerprint section processed 292,712 (Inked cards and Live Scan)
criminal arrest records. The Live Scan volume was 284,410 records (97%) and the card
scan volume was 8,302 records. The fingerprints section processed 180,129 fingerprint
based applicant requests including criminal justice requests. 	The Live Scan portion of
the civil requests totaled 143,466 or 79.7% and the mailed-in cards totaled 36,663. 	
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 						
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques,
based on the results of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	The
VFTP processed 321,166 transactions in 2011. Of these, 3,377 were denied based on
the results of a criminal history record check or the identification of another disqualifying
record. 	During 2011, 153 wanted persons were identified for extraditable offenses,
which resulted in the arrest of 85 individuals wanted in Virginia and 6 individuals who
were named in an outstanding warrant from another state. 	In 2011, the State Police
requested 772 criminal investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to purchase
firearms, which resulted in 604 (78%) closed arrests. 					
VCheck 											
VCheck is Virginia’s Internet-based Instant Background Check program. 	Approval
numbers are generated in instant clearances, while transactions that require review or
research are routed to the Firearms Transaction Call Center for processing. 	During
calendar year 2011, approximately 85% of the total transactions, statewide, were
processed via the Internet. 	As on-line users increase, staff is diverted from telephonic
firearm transactions to research and verification processes. Additional employee time

devoted to these other processes provide more efficient overall services to the firearm
dealers 	and 	firearm 	purchasers 	and 	cost 	savings 	to 	the 	Department 	and 	the
Commonwealth. 										
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun
dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification
number for qualified employees. 	As of December 31, 2011, the State Police issued
11,047 seller identification numbers. 									
Concealed Handgun Permits 									
Since 	July 	1, 	1995, 	574,259 	concealed 	handgun 	permits 	have 	been 	issued 	as
authorized by Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 47,626 were issued in 2011 by
Virginia Circuit Courts. In 2011, the State Police notified the Circuit Courts in 2,745
instances of disqualified holders of concealed handgun permits, of which 911 were
revoked. 	During 2011, 1,321 nonresident concealed handgun permits were issued by
the State Police, which is a 12% increase in the volume of nonresident permits issued in
2010. 	Additionally, in 2011, the State Police revoked 6 non-resident concealed
handgun permits upon the holder’s disqualification. 							
In accordance with the Code of Virginia, the State Police enters the permit holder’s
name and description in the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) so that the
permit's existence and current status will be made known to law-enforcement personnel
accessing the Network for investigative purposes. 	As of December 31, 2011, there
were 268,009 active concealed handgun permits issued by Virginia circuit courts
maintained in VCIN. 										
Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) 						
The Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) Section is responsible for
collecting monthly Incident 	Based 	Reporting (IBR) 	data from 	all 	contributing law
enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 Group A criminal offenses as well as
12 Group B criminal offenses. 	The UCR/IBR office no longer accepts summary
hardcopy reports or data submitted by diskettes. 	Data is submitted via the Internet
through the IBR Web site. 	This is a secure system to which only State Program
personnel and contributing agencies have access. 	Each day submitted files are run
through the edit process. 	This procedure generates an error report so that agencies
may correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database.
A monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated and emailed to the National Program (FBI)
for inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United States. 				
During 2011, the UCR/IBR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with training
issues, interpretation of error reports, and clarifications in offense definitions and
reporting procedures, as well as assisted computer software vendors with reporting
issues. Agencies were asked to review over 13,000 offenses regarding quality control
issues, make the necessary changes and resubmit their data. 					
													13
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 14 of 42”
Table: 14
The IBR responded to an estimated 3,200 phone calls regarding various IBR issues
from agencies and vendors as well as receiving or sending over 4,500 messages using
electronic mail. 								
There are 19 private vendors with software that transforms agency crime data into an
approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their own in-house
software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly statistical reports are now posted on the IBR
Web site rather than having to be mailed to each contributing agency. 	The UCR/IBR
office responded daily to requests for crime statistics from state agencies, government
officials, students, media, and the general public. 				
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter as well as, the annual report,
Crime in Virginia. 	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state
agencies are also informed of the availability of Crime in Virginia. 	In 2004, this annual
report was published for the first time on a CD rather than hardcopy. Beginning in 2007,
the annual report has been available exclusively through the State Police Web site.
This report contains Group A offenses submitted by each contributing agency in
Virginia, and Group A and Group B arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	These
data comprise the official crime statistics for Virginia and are used for law enforcement
budget funding, inmate forecasting, and in the legislative process. 			
The IBR contributing agency Web site went into production in 2002. 	Currently, there
are 283 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through the Internet.
This Web site provides law enforcement agencies with the convenience of on-line
monthly data submission, receiving timely error notifications, monthly and year-to-date
statistical 	reports, 	performing 	searches 	and 	ad 	hoc 	reporting, 	viewing 	manuals,
bulletins, and posting inquiries in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. 	
The 2011 Crime in Virginia report will be available in the spring of 2012. Since 2008,
this report has been formatted and published within the IBR Unit which has reduced
expenses and provides an earlier distribution date. 				
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) 									
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 684 member agencies with 32,238 certified
operators. 	The system has 14,148 terminals, of which 3,563 are fixed terminals and
10,585 are mobile terminals. In 2011, VCIN processed 425,603,464 transactions (an
increase of 3% over the 2010 totals) between NCIC/ National Law Enforcement
Telecommunications 	System 	(NLETS) 	member 	agencies 	and 	state 	computer
databases. 									
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system,
which is critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems store
information relating to wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles, and
protective orders. 								
									14
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 15 of 42”
Table: 15
Enhancements 	in 	the 	“E-Magistrate” 	and 	“Hotfiles” 	systems 	have 	improved 	the
statistical information available through VCIN/NCIC. 	In 2011, there were 182,476
warrants entered into the VCIN/NCIC system. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia
information for 1,753 missing adults, 11,079 missing children, and 9,583 stolen vehicles.
In 2009, for the first time, system enhancements allowed VCIN to track the number of
protective order transactions throughout the period instead of the number of orders on
file at any given time. 	In 2011, there were 11,703 Orders of Protection, 15,776
Preliminary Protective Orders, and 43,018 Emergency Protective Orders entered into
the VCIN system. 									
E-Magistrate 										
In 2009, the Supreme Court of Virginia implemented an automated interface named E-
Magistrate. This automated interface permits warrants and Protective Orders issued by
magistrates to be automatically entered into VCIN and NCIC. 	This streamlined
process ensures that data is available to law enforcement within thirty minutes of the
issuance of the aforementioned legal documents. In 2011, there were 155,303 records
entered into VCIN/NCIC through this interface. 						
Availability of Department of Motor Vehicle Images via VCIN 			
Virginia DMV images are available to Virginia law enforcement agencies through the
Virginia State Police, Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) using the OpenFox
Messenger application. 	Alternatively, they will be available to interface agencies that
have completed the programming to their VCIN interface as advised. In 2011, the VCIN
system processed an average of over 55,000 requests per month from law enforcement
agencies for DMV images. 								
Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse 				
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse was formed by an act of the
Virginia General Assembly on July 1, 1983. 	The clearinghouse is to assist in the
implementation of federal and state laws relating to missing children, and the inclusion
of 	programs 	to 	coordinate 	efforts 	between 	local, 	state, 	and 	federal 	agencies 	in
recovering missing children and promoting community awareness of the issue. 		The
Clearinghouse operates as Virginia’s center for missing children administered through
the Virginia Department of State Police. The clearinghouse is linked to all Virginia law
enforcement agencies through the VCIN system and all United States police agencies
through NCIC and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 		
Virginia Amber Alert System 							
A new system was developed in March 2006 to automate the entry and notification
process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 	The system is designed to provide a
comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the safe recovery of
a child and capture of the abductor. 							
Local law enforcement agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request
form, enter the information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 		The
											15
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 42”
Table: 16
system has significantly reduced the time required to get this information out to the
public. 	
In 2011, 11 requests were received for an Amber Alert activation and 2 requests met
the criteria and were activated. 	In the 9 cases where the criteria was not met, 2
Endangered Missing Child Alerts were issued. 	
Virginia Senior Alert Program 	
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia General Assembly created the Virginia
Senior Alert Program. 	This program, managed by the Criminal Justice Information
Services Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police to publicize an
incident of a missing senior adult. 	When activated, the information is publicized at
www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our media partners. In 2011, the Senior
Alert process was activated on 2 occasions. 	
Property and Finance Division 	
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of property management,

and distribution of more than $31,513,517 in supplies and equipment in 2011. 	The
Property and Finance Division is also responsible for the management and maintenance
of 115 buildings and grounds across the state. 	
Currently, the Public Safety Driver Training Facility, located in Nottoway County, is under
construction. We anticipate the estimated date of completion to be August 2012. 	
The Department also has a new Target Firing Range under design development which
will be located adjacent to the Driver Training Facility. 	Additionally, a new BCI office
located near Castlewood, Virginia, is under design development. 	
The Property and Finance Division oversees the mailroom and printing sections which
processed 306,427 pieces of mail during 2011 and printed 2,685,747 copies. 	In 2011,
$441,099 was spent in postage. 	
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military
Property Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no
cost, military property and equipment that is in excess of the Department of Defense
needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as the point of contact, and
provides a state coordinator. 	The program serves over 330 Virginia law enforcement
agencies, and in 2011, the program distributed goods valued over $2,147,000. 	
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day
operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program,
“The 1122 Program.” This program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to
purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic activities through the
	16
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 17 of 42”
Table: 17
federal procurement channels at substantial savings. 	During 2011, over $1,379,998
worth of goods were purchased through this program, saving the Department $149,617.
The Property and Finance Division is also responsible for the preparation of monitoring
and accounting for the Department’s annual budget in excess of $296 million for 2011,
including approximately $15.5 million of federal grants. 	VSP requested additional
appropriation of $581,000 through the Department of Planning and Budget. 			
The Property and Finance Division processes payments to vendors in accordance with
established policies and procedures issued by various entities, including, but not limited
to the State Department of Accounts and Federal agencies. Payments are processed in
compliance with the “Prompt Payment Act.” 						
Security, patrol services and background information are routinely provided to other state
agencies, localities and private entities for which the Department seeks reimbursement.
The Property and Finance Division, along with other Divisions of the Department, bills for
these services provided by the Department. 	It is the responsibility of the Property and
Finance Division to collect the receivables and record deposits to the proper accounts, as
well as seek alternative solutions to collect on bad debt. 					
The Property and Finance Division is responsible for accounting for drug-related seizures
in accordance with applicable state and federal guidelines and reporting requirements.
The Property and Finance Division is also charged with managing the awarded $44
million settlement related to the Purdue Pharmaceutical case. 				
The Property and Finance Division prepares all state and federal reporting in compliance
with applicable State and Federal regulations, working with the State Auditor of Public
Accounts and Federal auditors. 	Along with VSP’s Office of Performance Management
and 	Internal 	Controls 	(OPMIC), 	the 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	ensures 	the
Department’s 	compliance 	with 	the 	Agency 	Risk 	Management 	and 	Internal 	Control
Standards (ARMICS). 									
Information Technology Division 								
The Information Technology Division (IT) provides the computer infrastructure in support
of Virginia State Police's public safety mission and services to the citizens of the
Commonwealth. The IT Division is responsible for many mission critical systems and
applications which support local, state and federal law enforcement efforts. 			
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 						
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest
information, including fingerprints, mug shots and palm prints, to the State Police and
the FBI. 	This process enhances an agency’s ability to detect aliases and outstanding
warrants on arrestees prior to their release. 	Fingerprint-based civil requests are also
submitted 	electronically 	and 	provide 	the 	requesting 	agency 	with 	state 	and 	FBI
responses within 24 hours. 									
											17
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 18 of 42”
Table: 18
During 2011, criminal arrest records and identification bookings were received and
processed from 270 unique Live Scan units throughout the state. Likewise, Correctional
records on inmates and probation and parolees were received and processed from 58
Live Scan units. 	In 2011, 97.16% of the criminal and correctional transactions
processed were received through Live Scan. 						
During 2011, civil submissions were received and processed from a total of 338 unique
live scan units; some of these being criminal justice units also used for the purposes of
submitting criminal background checks for concealed weapons permits, criminal justice
applicants, etc. Seventy-nine percent of the civil transactions processed during 2011 	
were received through Live Scan. 							
Digital Crime Scene Images (DCSI) 						
DCSI, a system troopers and agents use to upload digital images from crime scenes and
accidents to the Photo Lab, was installed on Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) and
Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) desktops, laptops, and mobile data terminals (MDTs) in
2009 and 2010. 	In 2011, over 5,600 uploads with a total of nearly 148,500 photos were
sent from 850 field users to the Photo Lab for same-day or next-day processing, reducing
the turnaround time of prints to the requester by at least seven days. 	Only .007% of the
photos received were not uploaded from the field. 	Ninety-three percent of the images
submitted needed printing, resulting in a savings of nearly $1,000 in printing costs. 	
Central Criminal Image System (CCIS) 						
CCIS receives mug shots and images of scars, marks and tattoos from the AFIS system.
Virginia law enforcement agency personnel log in to search for images of known
offenders by State ID (SID) or for suspects by characteristics such as height and weight
range, race, gender, eye color, hair color, etc. They can create lineups, reports, and run
facial recognition searches. In 2011, over 199,000 records with a total of nearly 277,500
images were added to the system by AFIS. Over 50 agencies have access to CCIS, and
their users logged in over 4,000 times and performed over 5,000 searches, created nearly
500 lineups, and printed over 2,750 reports. 						
Personnel Division

Section, and the Counterterrorism and Criminal Interdiction Unit. 					
General Investigation Section (GIS) 								
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement
agencies. 	Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the
state to ensure that an adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable
time. 													
During 2011, GIS conducted 3,178 investigations, of which 1,284, or 40%, resulted from
requests from other law enforcement agencies. 	GIS Special Agents made a total of
2,286 arrests. 											
Crime Scene Examination 										
The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the Division of Forensic
Science. The technicians are often called upon by other State Police employees and by
local law enforcement agencies to examine, evaluate and collect evidence at crime

additional cases. 	A total of 91 arrests were recorded in these cases. 	These crimes
included homicide, rape and robbery. 						
Our criminal profilers conducted 62 case profiles for the year for the Department and for
other federal and local law enforcement agencies. 	Additionally, our agents conducted
51 training programs relating to homicides, sex crimes and hostage negotiations. 	
Arson Investigation 							
A Lieutenant, who is assigned to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation Director’s Office,
is the Chief Arson Investigator and coordinates activities between the Bureau of
Criminal Investigation and other investigative and regulatory agencies throughout the
state. 										
Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by localities.
During 2011, the Chief Arson Investigator provided or assisted in providing the following

Table: 25
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically
trained to investigate arson-related matters. 	In 2011, GIS conducted 355 fire scene
investigations 									
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters 						
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically
trained to investigate bomb and explosive-related matters. 	2011, there were 221
explosives-related incidents requiring the GIS to respond and provide explosives-related
expertise. During 2011 there were 68 hoax and suspicious items requiring examination
by bomb technicians. 								
Auto Theft Agent Activities 							
The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents work closely with the Virginia Department of
Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance Crimes Bureau, the Insurance Industry, and
federal and local law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes related to auto theft
rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other illegal activity. 				
In 2011, the Special Agents conducted 124 motor vehicle theft investigations, resulting
in 26 arrests and the recovery of 53 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment with
a combined value of $962,343. 	They also conducted 18 vehicle ID verifications for
other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. 				
Auto 	Theft 	Agents 	coordinate 	monthly 	regional 	meetings 	with 	other 	auto 	theft
investigators 	and 	insurance 	company 	special 	investigative 	units 	across 	the
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These meetings are held to discuss current automobile
theft trends and coordinate enforcement efforts among agencies. In addition, members
of the unit provide auto theft investigation training to numerous Troopers and local law-
enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police Academy and at regional training
academies. 									
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) 							
This is an insurance industry-funded program established in 1992 by Section 38.2-414
of the Code of Virginia to receive motor vehicle theft-related tips and to provide cash
rewards to the callers. The H.E.A.T. Program also provides leadership and assistance
to more than 175 state and local law enforcement agencies throughout Virginia by
providing training; conducting promotional events, prevention seminars and VIN Etching
events; offering grant funding; and procuring specialized equipment. 			
H.E.A.T. conducts basic and advanced motor vehicle theft investigation schools for law
enforcement, as well as instruction in motor vehicle theft prevention to crime prevention
specialists and Operation HEATWave Coordinators throughout the year. To enhance
Virginia’s 	vehicle 	theft 	investigative 	abilities, 	the 	H.E.A.T. 	office 	provides 	training
scholarships for local investigators to receive specialized training conducted by the
International Association of Auto Theft Investigators. 					
										25
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 26 of 42”
Table: 26
The 	H.E.A.T. 	office 	coordinates 	the 	deployment 	of 	bait 	cars 	used 	in 	high 	theft
jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. Mobile Data Hunter vehicles have
also been deployed throughout the state to locate stolen vehicles. 					
The H.E.A.T. Program works to increase the public’s awareness about the problem of
motor vehicle theft, theft prevention devices and strategies by using a variety of
marketing approaches including banner advertising and a Facebook Fan page. Citizens
are directed to visit HeatReward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information and
to report suspected motor vehicle theft. Individuals can also call the H.E.A.T. Hotline, 1-
800-947-HEAT (4328), if they have any motor vehicle theft-related information. 	
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted in a
momentous reduction in Virginia’s vehicle theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s motor
vehicle theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately 52 percent. 	
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) 									
In 1999, the General Assembly approved the establishment of an Insurance Fraud
Investigative Program within the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. This program is
funded by an assessment on property and casualty insurance premiums. The purpose
of the program is to: 										
1. Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the
Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is
currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent of such
insurance fraud; 										
2. Respond 	to 	notifications 	or 	complaints 	alleging 	insurance 	fraud 	generated 	by
federal, state and local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental
agencies or Units, and any other person; 								
3. Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected
fraud that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the
investigations. 										
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by the
total amount of claimed loss actually received by individuals submitting suspected
insurance fraud claims. During 2011, more than $2 million was actually collected by
individuals suspected of insurance fraud, and the total amount involved in suspicious
claims attempted, but not collected, was more $9.7 million. 					
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000
for the increased cost of goods and services. This Program is dedicated to reducing the
impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of Virginia as well as
raising public awareness of insurance fraud. This is accomplished through several
marketing strategies including the website StampOutFraud.com, banner advertising and
												26
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 27 of 42”
Table: 27
a Facebook Fan page. Citizens can also call a toll-free hotline, 1-877-62FRAUD (1-877-
623-7283), with information about suspected insurance fraud. 				
A reward program has been established to provide rewards of up to $25,000 to citizens
who report information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of individuals committing
insurance fraud. 	In 2011, the Insurance Fraud Program paid out $7,000 in rewards.
Since its inception, the program has paid out $83,250 to individuals who reported
suspected insurance fraud. 							
During 2011, 2,035 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance fraud were
received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and general public.
There were 252 criminal investigations initiated by the Special Agents, and 231 arrests
for insurance fraud and related offenses. More than 140 insurance fraud cases were
prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered restitution of $149,941 during 2011.
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 						
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance
abuse laws. The Section remains committed to its support of local law enforcement
agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. Seven DES regional field offices also help
in this effort by supporting special operations initiated by other law enforcement entities.
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian
support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 					
	• 	DES Regional Field Offices 							
	• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 						
	• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 						
	• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 					
	• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations 							
	• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 						
In 2011, DES field offices participated in 1,416 investigations that yielded $75,343,872
in seized narcotics, $3,193,225 in seized currency, and 186 persons arrested on 321
felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 727 persons were arrested on 1,138
felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES assisted other agencies. Special
Agents also seized 27 vehicles and 55 weapons. 	Additionally, 217 actual meth labs
were dismantled. 									
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 							
During 2011, DES participated in 37 state and local multi-jurisdictional task forces,
encompassing 121 local jurisdictions. These multi-jurisdictional task forces participated
in 	4,970 	investigations 	that 	accounted 	for 	$28,255,625 	in 	illicit 	drug 	seizures,
$4,850,885 in seized U.S. currency, and 3,097 persons arrested on 4,655 charges.
These task forces also seized 70 vehicles and 271weapons.

Marijuana Eradication Program 							
The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the cultivation of the marijuana plant.
Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop.
With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other
state and local law enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard,
conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically-grown marijuana. 	In 2011, the
State Police and local law enforcement agencies found 23,368 plants in 212 outdoor
plots. 	There 	were 	also 	4,492 	marijuana 	plants 	eradicated 	in 	82 	indoor 	grows.
Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 270 arrests. 	Seizures included 215
weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at $368,564.93. 	Considering
the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of
marijuana not reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $84
million. 											
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) 				
The GIANT mission is to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among
member agencies. The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 					
1. Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both
indoor and outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful 	
prosecution of the growers as a primary goal; 					
2. Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to
monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by
locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 					
3. Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway;
4. Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in
communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement 	
authorities, and; 								
5. Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the 	
maximum extent possible. 							
GIANT performed 438 operations during 2011 that resulted in 236 arrests, and the
seizure of $67,324,957.00 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 165 weapons, 56
vehicles, and $194,537.93 in U.S. currency. 						
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 							
The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents work with the DEA, the Department of
Health Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law
enforcement agencies to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes.
During 2011, Drug Diversion received 677 complaints of diversion activities throughout
the Commonwealth. 	In response to these complaints, 1,184 investigations were
initiated. 	A total of 621 persons were arrested on 1,109 charges. 	Additionally, 31
search warrants were executed during the past year. 					
											28
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 29 of 42”
Table: 29
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement officials
about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they
can do about it. 	This role also included educating health care professionals, both
physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and the importance of
self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their individual health care delivery systems.
During 2011, 12 presentations were conducted for 500 healthcare professionals. 	The
Drug Diversion Unit, with assistance from the Department of Health Professions and the
National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (N.A.D.D.I.), hosted the Eleventh
Annual Drug Diversion School in Roanoke, Virginia. 					
Criminal Intelligence Division 							
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document,
analyze, and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in criminal
activity to include terrorism. 	CID is currently composed of three units; the Field
Intelligence Unit, the Virginia Fusion Center and the Joint Terrorism Task Force or
“JTTF”. 									
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to
collect and provide intelligence, including information on current investigations. The unit
is active in each of the Department’s seven field divisions. 	The Field Intelligence Unit
also has five agents assigned to the various FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces. 	
The VFC operates the Terrorism Hotline and the Drug/Gang Hotline which are initiatives
that provide a conduit for the public to provide information on both terrorist and criminal
activities. 	The Homeland Security Information Network, Virginia Portal (HSIN-VA)
allows for public and private entities that have a need and right to access certain
databases a method of retrieving common operating picture information. 	During 2011,
VFC responded to approximately 3,000 requests for information (RFI’s) from entities
including federal, state, local, JTTF, military, out of state, Virginia, and Virginia State
Police law enforcement personnel. 	Additionally, the VFC provided multiple training
classes to over 160 state and local government personnel concerning the management
and protection of national security information. 					
The VFC’s Critical Infrastructure Key Resource (CIKR) Unit focuses on detecting,
deterring, and mitigating natural and manmade incidents impacting the Commonwealth.
This 	is 	accomplished 	by 	identifying, 	collecting 	and 	analyzing 	key 	assets 	and
dependencies, suspicious activity reporting and trend data. 	This data is then shared
with federal, state, and local entities to prevent or more efficiently manage incident
scenes. 									
The purpose of the Fusion Liaison Officer (FLO) program is to provide local, state and
federal agencies with an increased intelligence capability, and to provide a statewide
reporting and trend analysis capability to our partners. 	The FLO program enhances
Intelligence led policing, which is a concept by which law enforcement and other first
										29
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 30 of 42”
Table: 30
responder agencies pool information and utilize predictive analysis to ultimately prevent
criminal activity rather than respond to it. 						
The FLO training program consists of 16 hours of classroom instruction. 	Examples of
some of the topics include: FLO Program Overview, Virginia Fusion Center Orientation,
Terrorism, Gangs, and Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR). This training is approved
by the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) for law enforcement in-
service credit. During 2011, 196 individuals representing over 30 agencies attended the
FLO training program. 	The programs were held in Newport News, Culpeper, and
Williamsburg, Virginia Beach and at the Virginia State Police Academy. 		
The Criminal Intelligence Division also supports the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s
Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF). These regionally assigned special agents work full
time with the FBI on terrorism related investigations. 					
High Tech Crimes Division 						
The High-Tech Crimes Division (HTCD) was created August 1, 2009, in an effort to
consolidate the agency’s multiple cyber initiatives under a single command, and
enhance the agency’s capacity to conduct cyber-crime investigations, digital forensic
analysis, and child exploitation/pornography investigations. 				
This 	endeavor 	incorporates 	High-Tech 	Crimes 	Section 	with 	agents 	from 	each
geographical field division, the Computer Evidence Recovery Section, the Northern
Virginia/District of Columbia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (NOVA-DC
ICAC), and the Technical Support Section. 						
High-Tech Crimes Section 							
The personnel assigned to this section conducted numerous cyber-crime related
investigations, and assisted local, state, federal, and international law enforcement
personnel in their investigations of these complex crimes. 	These duties include the
examination 	of 	computer 	systems, 	cellular 	telephones, 	and 	other 	digital 	devices
connected to criminal activity. 	The year-to-date measures reflect that personnel in this
section conducted 157 investigations, which resulted in 59 arrests. 	In addition, section
personnel presented 22 crime prevention programs to various groups to enhance public
awareness of the dangers of identity theft and other cyber-crime related crimes. 	
NOVA / DC ICAC Task Force 							
The personnel assigned to the NOVA/DC ICAC Task Force have conducted numerous
investigations, and assisted local, state, federal, and international law enforcement
personnel in their investigations of child pornography, molestation, and other child
exploitation 	related 	offenses. 	The 	year-to-date 	measures 	reflect 	that 	task 	force
personnel are responsible for providing training to 428 law enforcement officers, and
providing crime prevention awareness to more than 20,000 citizens. In addition, the task
force processed 534 CyberTips received from the National Center for Exploited and
Missing Children (NCMEC), participated in 459 investigations, and performed over 400
									30

forensic examinations of digital evidence. Their efforts resulted in 199 arrests involving
child pornography and other child exploitation offenses. 					
Computer Evidence Recovery Section 						
The personnel in this section are specially trained to conduct comprehensive digital
forensic analysis for all cyber-related criminal activity. 	The section provides digital
forensic analysis to local, state, and federal law enforcement personnel, as well as,
providing expert court testimony. 	Year-to-date measures reflect that the section
provided 274 hours of training, examined 523 devices containing 62,974 gigabytes of
data, completed 39 digital previews, and completed 102 separate requests for services.
Technical Support Unit 										
The personnel in this section provide technical and surveillance support to local, state,
and federal law enforcement. 	The year-to-date measures reflect the section was
provided 255 hours of training, handled 104 cases, and 1,735 requests for service.
Services 	include 	responding 	to 	11 	hostage/barricaded 	subject 	incidents, 	and 	72
requests for courtroom closed-circuit audio/video systems in child victim cases. The
section also performed enhancement services on 50 audio/video files and installed 139
video systems. 		The complex and covert nature of this special group has been
instrumental in the successful investigation and prosecution of numerous criminal
matters and is absolutely essential to the continued success of the organization’s
mission. 												
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 				
CCI was established in 2003 to interdict narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public
transportation systems, school and businesses. 	Additionally, CCI provides seven
regional response teams to address chemical, nuclear and bio-terrorism events. 	In
2005, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new strategic initiative developed to
diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes. 					
Statistical Information for Partnership Activities 						
The 	Counter-Terrorism 	& 	Criminal 		Interdiction 	Unit 	participated 	in 	a 	successful

		BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 			
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over
64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. Uniformed
State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as
the need arises and based upon the ability of local law enforcement to respond. The
bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program
regarding the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations,
and the Aviation Unit that provides aerial support for law enforcement activities and
emergency medical evacuations. 							
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed
police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further subdivided into 48
State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or counties. Staffing is
allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county level. 		
Enforcement Initiatives to Enhance Highway Safety and Public Safety
Checkpoint Strikeforce 									
Identifying 	and 	removing 	drunk 	drivers 	from 	the 	highways 	of 	the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia is a primary objective of State Police Troopers 	
in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation. Checkpoint 	
Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that involves 	
saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on specific 	
highways and in locations where alcohol related incidents and arrests have 	
been identified. This national campaign is supported by the National Highway Traffic
Safety 	Administration 	(NHTSA) 	and 	involves 	significant 	public 	education 	and
awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 						
During 2011, a total of 2,453 vehicles passed through 8 DUI sobriety checkpoints
resulting in 18 drunk driving arrests. Additionally, DUI saturation patrols were conducted
on Interstates, primary and secondary highways throughout Virginia resulting in arrest
and the removal160 alcohol impaired drivers. 					
										32

Operation Air, Land, and Speed 			
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and
implemented an enforcement plan in July, 2006, to effectively reduce and eliminate
vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort was also
intended to combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving behavior on
Interstates that pass through Virginia to make travel in our Commonwealth safe and
enjoyable for motorists. 				
With the success of this program, five enforcement phases were conducted in 2011:

Highway fatalities – 0 						
During the 5 enforcement phases conducted throughout the year 2011, there was one
fatal crashes on the involved interstate highways where enforcement was increased and
visibility heightened. Virginia has experienced only four fatal crashes since the
program’s inception. 						
Click-it-or-Ticket 						
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the primary
functions of this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen a steady average
increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in 1997, to 81.8 %
recorded in 2011, which is the second consecutive year for Virginia with a usage rate
above eight percent. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness, education, and
enforcement to gain compliance with existing safety belt laws. Increasing the use of
safety belts and child safety seats have statistically shown to decrease deaths and
serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes. During the May phase of Click-it-or-Ticket
state police personnel issued 1,653 summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 488
summonses for child safety restraint violations. 			
Operation C.A.R.E. 						
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major holidays of
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are the primary
purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.). 	
During these major holiday periods that are noted for increased highway travel, the
Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address highway
safety and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth.

Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 					
During 2011, each of the department’s seven field divisions continued enforcement
emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within the counties in their
divisions. 	Each 	division’s 	program 	focused 	resources 	on 	those 	highways 	where
crashes, traffic violations, and citizen complaints regarding traffic were noted. The
objectives of this initiative were to prevent crashes, reduce violations, and address the
concerns citizens identified as threats to their safety. 				
Virginia State Fair 									
On September 22, 2011, the State Fair of Virginia welcomed visitors to “The Meadow
Event Park” in Caroline County. The State Police is fully responsible for all safety and
security 	duties 	associated 	with 	the 	fair, 	its 	vendors, 	the 	exhibitors, 	entertainers,
thousands of visitors and all traffic management in and around the fair grounds. During
the eleven days of the annual event an estimated 250,000 visitors attended the fair to
partake of the art and crafts, the competitions, the displays, and the general festivities.
Playing host to one-quarter of a million visitors places a high demand on services and
available resources. During the operational hours of the fair, troopers and supervisors
responded to calls for service ranging in nature from lost property, missing persons,
medical emergencies, disabled vehicles and suspicious activity, just to name a few.
Safety Division 										
As 	of 	December 	31, 	2011, 	there 	were 	4,432 	active 	inspection 	stations 	located

to Danville and in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. Effective April 30, 2010 the Med-Flight
III program closed, it is now used only for law enforcement operations. In 2011, all 3
programs responded to a total of 2,563 requests with 793 patients transported. The total
number of flights for all three programs from April 1, 1984 to December 31, 2011 was
31,435 responses to calls with 18,016 patients transported as a result of these calls.
Search and Rescue 							
During 2011 the Aviation Unit responded to 128 requests for searches for escapees,
missing persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward Looking Infra-Red
system on four helicopters and a 30 million-candlepower searchlight on the other
helicopters, the Unit has been successful in locating fugitives, missing persons, and lost
children. 								
Surveillance 							
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2011, the Unit was
requested 2 times for drug or narcotic surveillance, 10 times for other criminal matters
and 31 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 510 marijuana plants were located at a value of
$10,000.00. 								
Other Duties

Table: 38
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires,
providing gasoline, jump-starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone
calls for additional assistance or to notify family members of a stranded motorist's
situation. Motorist Assistance Aides also were instrumental in the arrest of drunk drivers
and 	aggressive 	drivers 	by 	reporting 	erratic 	driving 	behavior 	to 	troopers 	who
subsequently made the apprehension. 						
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 						
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary
responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that
utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. During 2011, approximately 17 million
commercial 	vehicles 	passed 	through 	Virginia's 	13 	permanent 	weigh 	stations 	for
inspection. Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement
initiatives, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 35,245 summonses and
made 147 criminal arrests. This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway safety
program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized vehicles;
through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the
highways; and through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they
are properly licensed to operate a commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 		
Crime Prevention 								
During 2011, the Department provided specialized presentations, security assessments,
and training to citizens of Virginia. This was accomplished through the use of Certified
Crime Prevention Specialist troopers who have received advanced training on current
crime prevention trends and techniques. Participating troopers receive continual training
to enhance their ability in protecting governmental, business, and residential security
through the "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model and
other mitigation based methodologies. Additional training is focused on personal safety,
workplace violence prevention and personal information associated crimes. All training
is part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to achieve
certification or remain certified through the Department of Criminal Justice Services as
Crime Prevention Specialist. 							
In 2011, approximately 103,177 citizens of Virginia and visitors were contacted through
2,168 	various 	crime 	prevention 	and 	safety 	programs. 	These 	programs 	allowed
distribution of nearly 22,000 informational handouts and brochures. Crime Prevention
Troopers conducted 210 crime prevention programs and 574 Traffic Safety Programs.
In addition, 105 programs were conducted to address personal safety, 29 addressed the
issues of road rage, 7 workplace violence workshops were held, and 5 programs were
sponsored on recognizing and preventing schemes and scams. Crime prevention
troopers also conducted security assessments on 341 businesses and residences.
Additionally, during 2011, troopers conducted 20 drug education programs, 2 Class
Action programs, and 2 Help eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) programs to enhance
safety in Virginia communities.
