THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF STATE POLICE
SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 	
The Superintendent, with the rank of Colonel, is appointed by the Governor and serves as agency head
of the Virginia Department of State Police. On Jan. 31, 2002, Governor Mark R. Warner re-appointed
Colonel W. Gerald Massengill as Superintendent. 	
The Department is divided primarily into three Bureaus: Administrative and Support Services, Criminal
Investigation, and Field Operations. The Superintendent’s Office includes the Professional Standards Unit
and the Public Affairs Unit. 	
The directors of the three Bureaus report directly to the Deputy Superintendent. 	Also reporting to the
Deputy Superintendent is the Executive Protective Unit and the Public Affairs Unit.
Professional Standards Unit 	
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs, internal audit and staff
inspection functions within the Department of State Police. 	
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations of
misconduct on the part of Department employees. During 2001, 830 internal investigations were
processed. 	
The Internal Audit Section provides the Department with independent and objective audits and
reviews of Department operations. During 2001, the section provided 16 comprehensive reports
of operating sections within the Department. The reports included recommendations for
strengthening internal controls. 	
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components within the
Department. Nine staff inspections were conducted in 2001. 	
Public Affairs Unit 	
The Public Affairs Unit (PAU) maintains daily contact with the public and media, disseminates
news releases about Department programs and activities, develops and implements public
awareness programs and answers questions on many topics. Personnel in this unit often respond
to the scenes of major highway and criminal incidents to assist the media in providing information
to the public. The staff includes the director of public affairs and a public relations specialist at
Administrative Headquarters and public relations coordinators deployed in field division
headquarters in Chesapeake, Fairfax, Richmond and Salem.

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT SERVICES
The Bureau of Administrative and Support Services is comprised of most of the Department’s non-sworn
personnel as well as some sworn employees. The Bureau includes the Divisions of Communications,
Criminal Justice Information Services, Data Processing, Personnel, Property and Finance, Training and a
Planning and Research Unit.
Employees in these areas provide the Department, especially troopers and special agents in the field,
with essential services through their extensive technical and professional expertise. These services range
from: 		
• 	Purchasing and configuring personal computers ... to designing complex and sophisticated
	computerized systems to maintain critical criminal files;
• 	Installing police radios and radar units in patrol vehicles ... to designing and implementing a
	Computer-Aided Dispatch System;
• 	Employing a qualified and diversified work force ... to managing an exciting volunteer program;
• 	Managing and maintaining Department buildings and grounds across the State ... to preparing,
	monitoring, and accounting for the Department’s annual budget;
• 	Providing criminal justice agencies with rapid access to local, state and national criminal justice
	files ... to supervising Virginia’s Firearms Transaction Program;
• 	Ensuring that all sworn employees meet mandated training requirements ... to overseeing the
	State’s Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Program; and
• 	Conducting research into innovative law enforcement techniques and products ... to coordinating
	the Department’s accreditation and grant management programs.
The Bureau also develops and proposes legislation involving traffic safety and criminal statutes, serves
as liaison during General Assembly sessions for discussion of issues.
	Communications Division
	Responsibility for the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of telephone, land mobile
	radio, and microwave radios is assigned to the Communications Division. Under the command of
	the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates and maintains land mobile
		2
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 3 of 24”
Table: 3
radios, microwave radios and private telephone networks. The system includes 87 microwave
radio sites, 46 of which also have land mobile radio base stations. This responsibility includes
compliance with requirements of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 	
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible for:
• 	Maintaining mobile radios; 	
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios; 	
• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals; 	
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, obstruction lighting, antennas and
	emergency power plants; 	
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices; 	
• 	Installing and maintaining equipment, telephones, and other telecommunications at
	Administrative Headquarters; and 	
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for mobile and fixed 	
	communications equipment. 	
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. Of the 23 sites considered to
be the backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to digital service. High
capacity digital service is now available to all Division Headquarters locations except Division II
and VII. Equipment has been obtained for Division VII, but reconfiguration will be necessary
because of recent changes to agreements with the Department of Defense. The Communications
Division is finalizing the design and preparing to procure the equipment necessary to provide
access to Division IV. Additionally, digital microwave service is being planned and obtained
through collocation agreements to provide complete digital access to sites on the Eastern Shore.
The FCC assigned 2 GHz microwave frequencies that the Department had been using to
companies providing Personal Communications Services (PCS). PCS providers were required to
relocate incumbent microwave users at no expense. All microwave paths, which were affected by
this action, have been successfully relocated, and upgraded to digital operation at virtually no
cost to the Commonwealth. Cooperative development or collocation agreements continue to fund
equipment upgrades from analog to digital microwave systems. Two new microwave sites are
being planned and six existing sites are to be upgraded to accommodate digital systems. The
total worth of these collocation and relocation agreements has saved the Department 	
approximately $8 million over the past six years. Work in progress will save another $500,000.
Upgrades to sites continue, with the most recent improvements made to Fort Lewis Mountain,
Poor Mountain, Pinnacle Ridge, Melfa, Salem Headquarters and Fairfax Headquarters. 	Buildings
are being replaced or refurbished as necessary, with capacity to support the new Shared Land
Mobile Radio Network. 		
The Division is supporting all field efforts of the STARS Project consultant selected to design and
engineer the upgraded State Police Land Mobile Radio Network that will serve all of the 	
Commonwealth’s state level public safety agencies. Licenses have been obtained from the FCC
for the necessary frequencies, and planning continues. 	
The Division has procured 150 mobile computer terminals (MCTs) and wireless modems to be
used for messaging and routine checks of drivers’ licenses and vehicle registrations. The
Communications Division is working with the Data Processing Division and the Department of
Information Technology to obtain mobile software, upgrade the server and incorporate the CAD
interfaces. 	Approximately 250 additional units are planned for procurement in the coming year.
Deployment of these units will be in Divisions 1, 2, 5 and 7 where public wireless data services
are currently available. Service will be provided to all areas by the STARS Project, once
completed.

Table: 4
All telephone systems at Administrative Headquarters and Division Headquarters have been
updated to a new modern system. 	In addition, many area offices have had telephone system
upgrades. 		
The Division continues to provide communications support for special events as they occur. Such
activities include communications systems to support security for visiting dignitaries, National
Drag Races in Dinwiddie County, the State Fair of Virginia, and the Inaugural festivities in
Richmond. The Communications Division also provisioned telephone service, set up portable
radios and temporary radio systems and provided around the clock support for the Department’s
initial response to the attack on the Pentagon. 	
In the past six months, the Division of Consolidated Laboratories successfully certified all field
Division radio shops as independent laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning
forks. 		
The Division supports telephone and local area network wiring requirements statewide for the
Department, as well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of
equipment are being maintained for six additional agencies. The Division also continues to
maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most of the state’s public safety
agencies. The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) activities to
improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area.
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all files
within the Department. This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction and archiving of
records in accordance with the Records Retention Schedule. 	The Division also acts as the point-
of-contact and liaison with the Library of Virginia. 	The Division processed and responded to
1,529 subpoenas and 104 Freedom of Information Act requests in 2001.
Central Criminal Records Exchange – The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and
processed 39,293 investigative reports in 2001. 	
Staff of the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) automated 1,435
non-computerized criminal records in calendar year 2001, leaving a total of 163,686
misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated. 	
The Supreme Court/State Police disposition interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 130
General District Courts and 125 Adult Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court
dispositions to CCRE. 	In 2001, 269,990 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to
submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions transmitted,
43,850 or 16.2 percent were rejected. 	In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system
was implemented. 	Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically
generated for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 	For 2001, notifications for 17,672 individual
charges were generated. The majority of notifications (83 percent) were generated because the
court did/could not include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data. The
remaining notifications (17 percent) were generated when the court had transmitted the
Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file.
The Non-criminal Justice Name-Search program continues to experience growth, with
363,124 inquiries processed in 2001. 	The demand for the service has increased 312 percent in
the past 10 years. 	The Non-criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented Feb. 8, 1996, to
effectively address the demand. 	The NCJI eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive
and process “paper record name-search requests.” 	As of December 31, there were 134,914
electronic name-search transmissions received from participants, with an average response time
of 72-hours or less since implementation. 	NCJI is upgrading, effective March 18, 2002, to access
through the Department’s Web site. 	This will tremendously enhance customer service.

Table: 5
The Mental Health File records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the
ability to purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these categories are 	
received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual being incompetent, 	
involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. 	There were 6,011 mental health records 	
added, bringing the total records on file to 40, 649. 		
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry –The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) 	
includes 10,354 fingerprint-based registrations received since July 1, 1998. 	The Registry is
designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by providing personal 		
descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of certain sex crimes. 		
Photographs of offenders are available, and violent offender registrations are maintained on the
Internet. 	There were 62,693 searches conducted against the Registry for employment-licensure
purposes in 2001. 	During 2001, the SOR verified the address of 13,971 sex offenders, and
initiated 4,952 criminal investigations to the field divisions. 		
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) interface was developed to comply with Section
19.2-390, Paragraph (E), of the Code of Virginia. 	The Department will be prepared to accept
Correctional Status Information (CSI) on March 15, 2002; however, the Department of 		
Corrections (DOC) is not agreeable to provide probationer statuses. 	This is not in compliance
with the mutually agreed upon “General Design” or the statutory requirement to report selected
probationers statuses to CCRE. 	Additionally, the Department has completed programming to
accept CSI from DOC’s inmate and probationer databases. 	This issue is being documented to
the DOC deputy director. 	Conversely, the inmate commitment conversion is being accomplished
very smoothly with genuine support and cooperation. 		
The Microfilm Section staff archived 1,368,006 documents during this calendar year. 		
Photographic Laboratory –The Photo Lab maintained records, files, film and responded to
18,472 letters of requests for photographs. 	Additionally, 191,788 photographic prints were 	
developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes
and criminal cases. 			
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) is a shared state and local computer
system. 	The Department and 22 state and local agencies have access to the system through
terminals located in their agencies. 	There are 1,383,540 fingerprint cards and 53,895 unsolved
latents on the database. 	During 2001, there were 1,246 suspects identified as a result of 	
searches on the AFIS system. 			
The Department’s live-scan network installed in local agencies, electronically captures and 	
transmits arrest and fingerprint information to the State Police and FBI, where it is searched on
AFIS as it is received. 	This provides for the detection of aliases and outstanding warrants before
arrested persons are released. 	Live-scan equipment is currently installed in 55 local agencies
and one correctional reception center. 	It is anticipated that 17 additional live-scan sites will be
installed in 2002. 			
During 2001, the fingerprint section processed 250,981 criminal, 102,676 applicant and 1,050 sex
offender fingerprint cards. 			
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) –The VFTP provides for the approval at the
point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based on the results of a criminal history record
information check on the buyer. In 2001, 192,653 firearm transactions were conducted. 	Of these,
2,612 were disapproved, and 102 wanted persons were identified with 68 arrests reported. 	Also,
in 2000, the State Police made 761 criminal arrests based on the illegal purchase, or attempted
purchase, of a firearm. 	Certificates for 344 multiple handgun purchases were issued authorizing
the purchase of more than one handgun within any 30-day period.

Table: 6
The Direct Access program has been tremendously successful with statistics indicating the
current on-site terminal dealers handled approximately 33 percent of the transactions processed
through the Firearms Transaction Center (FTC) during 2001. The FTC will continue to expand the
Direct Access program via additional participating dealer locations. 	As on-line users increase,
staff is diverted from telephoned firearm transactions to research and verification processes.
Additional employee time devoted to these processes provides more efficient overall services to
the firearm dealers and gun buying public. 	
Legislation by the 2000 Virginia General Assembly requires a fingerprint-based criminal
background check be performed for employees of a gun dealer to transfer firearms, and requires
the issuance of a Seller Identification Number by the Department of State Police for qualified
employees. 	In 2001, 3,024 seller identification numbers were issued. 	
The FTC maintains 6,001 machine gun registrations. 	Additionally, the FTC maintains the
Criminal Firearms Clearinghouse, a central repository of information regarding all firearms seized,
forfeited, found or otherwise coming into the possession of any law enforcement officer that are
believed to have been used in committing a crime. 	In 2001, 5,332 reports were made to the
Clearinghouse. 	Also, the State Police entered 11,164 concealed handgun permits into the
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN). 	Since July 1, 1995, a total of 168,538 permits have
been entered into VCIN. 		
Uniform Crime Reporting – The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for
collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement
agencies throughout the state on 46 different crime offenses. 	During 2001, 11 more agencies
became certified for IBR submission, bringing the total IBR agencies to 268. 	These agencies
represent 96 percent of the total UCR contributing agencies, and 99 percent of the total
population of Virginia. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hard copy reports. 	Data is
submitted by diskettes that are scanned, copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	Approximately
four times a month, this data is run through the edit process, which generates an error report for
the agencies to correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database.
A monthly tape of Virginia’s data is generated and sent to the FBI for inclusion in their annual
publication, Crime In The United States. 	
During 2001, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues, interpretation
of error reports and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting procedures, as well as,
assisting vendors with reporting issues. 	There are 16 private vendors representing IBR certified
agencies. 	Several large agencies have built their own in-house software systems. 	Quarterly
agency data reports were mailed to each contributing law enforcement agency. 	The UCR office
responded to approximately 10 requests daily for crime statistics. 	
Statistical crime data are published in the CJIS Newsletter and in the annual report, Crime in
Virginia, which are distributed to contributing agencies, commonwealth’s attorneys, judges,
legislators, and other state agencies. The annual report is available to the public for a nominal
fee. The 2000 annual report, published in June 2001, was the first publication to contain only IBR
data. The Crime In Virginia report can also be found on the State Police web site. 	Staff members
were diligent throughout the year informing the media and the public of the new reporting system,
and that comparisons to previous years should not be made. 	
The UCR office will begin collecting IBR data over the Internet beginning with January 2002,
submissions. 	A meeting was held in the fall with the selected pilot agencies to discuss plans for
this new project. 	The availability of this type of monthly submission will alleviate the mailing of
diskettes and error reports. 	Quarterly reports and manuals will also be posted on the Internet.
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN)/National Crime Information Center (NCIC) –
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 660 member agencies with 5,193 terminals. 	Of these, 2,237
terminals are non-mobile, and 2,956 are mobile terminals. 	In 2001, VCIN processed in excess of
195,000,000 transactions between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state computer
	6 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 7 of 24”
Table: 7
databases. 	This system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three 	
seconds. 			
Virginia agencies have entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which is
critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information relating to
wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia 	
information relating to 43,005 wanted persons, 994 missing persons, and 10,421 stolen vehicles.
In July, the Department completed the conversion from the dedicated terminal system to the 	
personal computer based (TCP/IP) protocol. 	This new protocol has permitted new agencies to
connect and existing agencies to expand their number of terminals. 	The VCIN conversion 	
prepared agencies in Virginia to participate in NCIC 2000. 	It is still the intent of the Department to
access NCIC 2000. 	The first phase will be fully operational by July 2002. 	The Department has
started to convert all the files over to the new NCIC 2000 program. 	The Department has 	
authorized specialty units dial-up access into the VCIN system. 	The Department has explored
the new Cyberlinxx software package as a method of accessing the VCIN system for inquiries
only. 			
The Department has installed new hardware in all the area offices, except Area 10 (Dulles 	
Greenway) and Area 75 (S.O.D. Hampton), to support the Cyberlinxx software. 	This software is
browser based, and uses existing state networks as a means of accessing the VCIN system. 	To
this date, 68 agencies have purchased Cyberlinxx software, with 11 agencies on line. 	This 	
system will be utilized first by the Department of Social Services, Child Support Enforcement 	
Section, county treasurers, and county commissioners of revenue to inquire on Virginia and other
selected states’ vehicle registration files. 	As with all new technology, the Department will be 	
required to develop strict guidelines to ensure the integrity of the VCIN/NCIC system is not 	
compromised. 			
Data Processing Division 			
The Data Processing Division operates one of the largest computer centers in state government.
Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment and software 	
provided by BULL Information Systems, NEC Corporation and UNISYS Corporation. The Division
operates two separate computer rooms 24 hours a day. 		
Automated Applicant Processing – In 2001, programming was completed that enabled the 	
automated processing of 91,537 applicant fingerprints, including electronic transmission to the
FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). 	This reduced the 	
turnaround time for state and national applicant fingerprint checks from 90 days to 24 hours. 	
The Live Scan Network was expanded to 68 systems, installed in 58 local agencies. 	Over 	
168,000 arrest fingerprints were electronically transmitted into State Police in 2001. 	This 	
represents more than 75 percent of the arrest volume in Virginia. 	Over 60 percent of the arrests
received electronically at State Police are processed without human intervention. 		
CAD/MIS – The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid
entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. The CAD system 	
consists of 15 servers, 42 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote access users. A total of 	
1,282,026 incidents were entered into the CAD system in 2001. 	Over 70 programs were changed
to create new CAD functionality, such as caller-id and automated dialing of wrecker services. 	An
interface to allow direct contact between mobile units and the CAD system has been designed
and will be implemented in 2002.

Other Services Provided 		
• 	A total of 245 laptop computers were purchased, set up, and distributed to every BCI
	agent in the Department. 		
• 	Firewalls and intrusion detection software were installed to protect networks and 	
	systems. 		
Personnel Division 		
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management, with
continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the work force. 	
Recruitment Section – The Department recruited for entry-level law enforcement positions for
the 102 nd Basic School from June 11, 2001, through Aug. 17, 2001. 	One thousand four hundred
thirty-seven applications were received. 	Fifty-four Trooper Trainees were hired and began Basic
School on Feb. 25, 2002. 		
The Department began taking applications for Trooper on a continuous basis in August 2001,
from jurisdictions East of the Mississippi. 	
The Department initiated a new selection process beginning with the applicant pool of the 105 th
Basic School. 	The physical fitness tests consisting of the 1.5 mile run, sit-ups, push-ups, and sit
and reach have been replaced with the Work Performance Test (WPT). 	The written examination
and Oral Interview Board have also been replaced with a new process conducted by Law
Enforcement Services, Inc. 		
The WPT is an ability course consisting of 10 tasks, which must be completed in a specified time.
Tasks include sprinting, a three-foot jump, a five-foot wall, a 10-foot low crawl, a step test, window
opening, suspect identification, a 150-pound dummy drag and a trigger control exercise. 	Upon
successful completion of the WPT, candidates will take a written examination that consists of a
battery of four tests that include two cognitive and two personality-trait tests. 	Once the candidate
completes the written portion, the candidate will complete a web-based Personal History 	
Questionnaire (PHQ). 	Candidates who successfully complete Phase I will move to Phase II, the
Polygraph Examination. 	Phase III is the Background Investigation, and Phase IV is the 	
Psychological Examination, Physical Examination and Drug Screen. 	This new system will
streamline the process while improving the quality of candidates offered employment. 	
Additionally, Trooper Recruiters have been approved for each of the seven BFO field divisions.
The Employment Section advertised 242 sworn and non-sworn positions (183 full-time and 59
part-time) during 2001. In addition to the 74 Trooper Trainees hired, five full-time sworn positions,
117 full-time non-sworn positions, and 43 part-time positions were filled during this same period.
The Department continued a Mediation Program for all agency employees. 	The Employment
Section processed 50 grievances in 2001. 	
During 2001, 51 volunteers gave 7,637 hours of their time in locations throughout the State.
Volunteers who served in 2000 were honored at a recognition event on April 26, 2001. 	
During 2001, the Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section 	
processed 292 hires, 92 promotions, 108 transfers, 166 separations and a number of address
and name changes. 	A large number of record inquiries were received including employment
history inquiries, legal inquiries from financial institutions, Freedom of Information Act inquiries
and other routine information requests. 		
Classification completed studies on Area Secretary Senior positions, and individual studies on
positions in Criminal Justice Information Services, Data Processing, Personnel, Property and
Finance, and various positions in the Bureaus of Field Operations and Criminal Investigation.
There were 28 classified position requests received; seven from the Bureau of Field Operations,
		8

Table: 9
two from the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, five from Data Processing, one from Criminal
Justice Information Services, one from Communications, eight from Property and Finance, two
from Personnel and two from Training. 		
In addition, during that same period, 11 wage positions were established, nine salary surveys
were completed, and numerous classification inquiries from other State agencies were answered.
The new Salary Administration Plan implementation resulted in 170 salary actions submitted for
consideration, to include requests for in-band adjustments, starting pay actions, competitive
salary offers and temporary pays. 	A new Performance Management Plan was also implemented
during this period. 		
Property and Finance Division 		
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial and property
management functions. 	It is responsible for preparing, monitoring and accounting for the
Department's annual operating budget, which was in excess of $206,432,818 for fiscal year 2001.
It was responsible for the procurement, warehousing and distribution of more than $18,183,247 in
supplies and equipment last year. 	The Property and Finance Division is also responsible for the
management and maintenance of more than 69 buildings and grounds across the State.
During FY2001, construction was completed on the new Area 6 office in Powhatan County.
Renovations and additions to the Area 3 office (West Point), and Area 2 office (Warsaw) were
completed. 		
In addition to its property and financial management duties, the Division oversees the mailroom
and printing sections, which processed 447,427 pieces of mail during 2001, and prints an
average of 10.5 million copies annually. 	It also manages the garage, which is responsible for
equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately 1,800 vehicles. 	
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military Property
Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost, military property,
and equipment that is in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is
appointed by the Governor as the point of contact, and provides as state coordinator. 	The
program serves over 200 Virginia law enforcement agencies and in 2001 the program distributed
goods valued over $3.5 million dollars. 		
In 1998 the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day
operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122
Program.” 	This program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law
enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic activities through the federal procurement
channels at substantial savings. 	During 200l over $5,000,000 at a saving of $1.5 million was
purchased through the program. 		
Training Division 		
During 2001, the Training Division ensured that all employees met mandated training 	
requirements and, through the Virginia State Police Academy, provided 9,143 hours of instruction
in 372 sessions for 8,251 employees and 61 students from outside agencies. 	
The 101st Basic School graduated 58 new troopers. 	Six CVEOs completed the 21st Commercial
Vehicle Enforcement Officer Basic Session and five completed the 22nd CVEO Basic Session.
Academy facilities were utilized by several outside agencies, including the Department of
Emergency Services, Department of Criminal Justice Services, Department of Juvenile Justice
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 	These 51 sessions provided 565 hours of instruction to
921 Department employees and 503 outside students. 	
The Division coordinated 4,443 hours of instruction by 391 of our employees to other police
academies, police departments, and colleges. 	In addition, the Division coordinated the

September 2000 - August 2001. 		
The 4-Safe-VA School Safety Program has continued to provide comprehensive statewide
training to school and law enforcement communities on current issues of school safety. 	In 20001,
1,945 people were instructed through the various programs offered, slightly below the 2000-year
totals. 	The Center for School Safety, under the Department of Criminal Justices Services, has
begun to provide training in several areas once solely provided by the 4-Safe-VA Program and
has caused a decrease in persons trained. 	A breakdown of program totals follows:

Planning and Research Unit 	
The Planning and Research Unit provides planning and policy support to all divisions of the
Department and is responsible for: 	
1. 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures and technologies;
2. 	Updating staffing formulas; 	
3. 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies;
4. 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s performance measures;
5. 	Providing support for developing grant applications and budgetary submissions;
6. 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan;
7. 	Maintaining departmental manuals; 	
8. 	Preparing the annual Use of Force Report;
9. 	Monitoring the Department’s budgeting performance measures; and
10. 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs and
	the Mandates on Local Government. 	
During 2001, the Unit completed three comprehensive studies of agency programs and
operations and three evaluations of new law enforcement equipment/technologies. Unit staff
worked in conjunction with the Virginia Sheriffs’ Association and the Virginia Association of Chiefs
of Police to prepare Racial Profiling in Virginia: An Analysis of State and Local Law Enforcement
Practices”. 	During this reporting period, staff assisted in the development of eight grant
applications. 	The Unit was also responsible for the implementation and management of the VSP
Idea Line, which is an internal communications tool designed to provide an upward and
downward flow of information within the agency. 	At the end of the year, the Unit was monitoring
17 grants that provide approximately $13.5 million for agency projects.
Accreditation 		
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement services
by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally accepted
standards. Accreditation requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of the Department’s
organization, operations, and administration. 	
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the nation
to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA),
Inc. in 1986. 	In 1991, 1996, and again in 2001, the Department achieved reaccreditation
following an on-site inspection and review by CALEA assessors of the agency’s policies,
procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for all
accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement
accreditation standards. 		
BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 	
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all criminal matters mandated
by statute and established Department policy through the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is
mandated to investigate any matter referred by the Governor. The Attorney General, commonwealth’s
attorneys, chiefs of police, sheriffs and grand juries may request the Department to investigate matters,
which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of elected officials
when directed by the Governor, Attorney General or grand juries. The Bureau consists of the Divisions of
Criminal Intelligence, Drug Enforcement, General Investigations and Insurance Fraud.

Criminal Intelligence Division 	
The primary purpose of the Criminal intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document and 	
disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime and terrorist
groups. 	The CID is composed of three units - the Research Unit, the Analytical Unit, Which
includes the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC) and the Technical Support Unit. 	
The CID operates the VCIC, which is a repository of intelligence information that is available to all
Virginia law enforcement personnel. 	VCIC personnel provide research and analytical support to
criminal justice agencies. 	Two research agents and seven field intelligence agents interact with
investigators and task forces to collect and supply information on current investigations. 	
CID is also responsible for the Virginia Narcotic Pointer Index system, the Help Eliminate Auto
Theft (HEAT) Hotline, the Drug Violation Hotline and the Insurance Fraud Hotline. 	During 2001,
VCIC personnel processed 623 Hotline calls. 	
The Department participates in the Virginia Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence 	
Documentation (VALID) and publishes a monthly intelligence bulletin, The VALIDATOR, which is
disseminated throughout the intelligence community. 	
CID administers for the Department; the Witness Protection Program which provides both funding
and technical assistance for the protection of threatened witnesses in the Commonwealth. 	The
Witness Protection Program assisted in the protection of 4 witnesses during 2001 from 	
jurisdictions located throughout the state. 	
Technical Support Unit 	-- In 2001, the Technical Support Unit received 731 requests for 	
service. 	Of those requests 639 were in support of federal, state and local law enforcement 	
agencies. 	Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal investigations, which were 	
supported with the installation of audio and video recording equipment. 	The Unit continues to
support significant investigations and uses methods and technologies to assist any requesting
law enforcement agency. 			
The Unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement agencies, as
well as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s attorneys’ offices through installation and
operation of closed circuit television systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	
The Hostage/Barricade Unit and Witness Protection Program were developed to support state
and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated technical equipment. The
Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to 14 Hostage/Barricade incident requests. 	
Drug Enforcement Division (DED) 	
DED continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws.
The Division remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to 	
enforce these same laws. 			
DED’s mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support 	
personnel in eight distinct functional areas: 	
• 	DED Regional Field Offices 		
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 	
• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 	
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Narcotics Interdiction Unit 	
• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 	
• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations 		
• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit 	
		12 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 13 of 24”
Table: 13
• 	Asset Forfeiture 			
DED Regional Field Offices – Seven DED Regional Field Offices perform operational narcotics
enforcement investigations, as well as support special operations (undercover, wire intercept,
marijuana eradication), initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 100 special agents
available for enforcement and task force duties at seven field offices. 		
From Jan. 1, 2001 through Dec. 31, 2001, the field offices participated in 1,667 investigations that
yielded $9,031,768 in seized narcotics; $183,192 in seized currency; and 441 persons arrested
on 562 felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 615 persons were arrested on 872 felony
and misdemeanor charges in cases where DED assisted other agencies. 	DED also seized 17
vehicles and 78 weapons. 			
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DED participates in 25 state/local multi-jurisdictional task
forces, encompassing 93 local jurisdictions. 	Twenty-seven State Police Special Agents and 125
local officers were assigned to state/local task forces. 		
During 2001, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 2,956 investigations that accounted
for $11,595,725 in illicit drug seizures; $301,085 in seized U.S. currency; and 1,735 persons
arrested on 2,282 charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that resulted
in 461 persons arrested on 635 charges. 	These task forces also seized 29 vehicles and 241
weapons. 				
Federal Task Forces – DED participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during 2001.
Thirteen State Police Special Agents, as well as officers from local police departments and
agents from Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), were assigned. 	The federal joint task forces conducted 37
investigations that accounted for $4,126,800 in drug seizures, and three persons arrested on 36
charges. 	These task forces also assisted in 60 arrests on 192 charges. 	Two vehicles and 10
weapons were seized. 			
Multi-jurisdictional Narcotics Interdiction Unit – On Sept. 24, 1996, the State Police formed
the Richmond Metro Interdiction Narcotics Task Force, including Chesterfield County, Henrico
County, Richmond and Petersburg Police Departments, Hanover County Sheriff’s Office, 	
Richmond International Airport Police Department, and the DEA. In 2001, the Task Force seized
133 pounds of marijuana, 107.8 ounces of cocaine, 3.6 ounces of heroin, 17 grams of 	
methamphetamine, and 17 dosage units of ecstasy, all having a street value of $208,940. 	Forty-
one suspects were arrested on 61 charges. 	Eleven firearms and $50,720 in U.S. currency also
were seized. 				
On July 1, 2001, the Multi-jurisdictional Narcotics Interdiction Unit was absorbed by the Drug
Enforcement Administration Task Force and no longer exists as previously established. 	
Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam – The Commonwealth remains a prime location
for the cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential
for being a major cash crop. 	With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with
assistance of other state and local law enforcement agencies, conduct a regular program to
eradicate domestically grown marijuana. 	The State Police and local law enforcement agencies
found 13,279 plants in 283 outdoor plots. 	There were also 2,783 marijuana plants eradicated in
53 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 254 arrests. 	Seizures included
117 weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at $188,850. 	Considering the 	
estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not 	
reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $16 million. 	
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to
facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Five special agents
are assigned to GIANT. The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 		
		13 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 14 of 24”
Table: 14
1. 	Development of 	intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and
	outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers
	as a primary goal of GIANT; 		
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor
	suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating
	clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 	
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the 	
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in
	communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and;
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum
	extent possible. 		
Six hundred three GIANT operations during this period resulted in 386 arrests, the seizure of
$15.2 million worth of narcotics, 97 weapons and $204,955 in U.S. currency. 	
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit
purposes continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. 	In fact, drug diversion predates the
massive abuse of other drugs we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit
works with the DEA, the Department of Health Professions and the Department of Medical
Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies, to eliminate the diversion of 	
prescription drugs to illicit purposes. 		
During 2001, the unit received 2,164 complaints of diversion activities throughout the 	
Commonwealth. 	In responses to these complaints, 1,738 investigations were initiated and the 13
special agents assigned to the Unit arrested a total of 1,444 persons on 1,529 charges. 	Of the
1,444 persons arrested, 22 were licensed health care professionals. 	Ten search warrants were
executed during the past year. 		
A major educational role of the unit is teaching local law enforcement officials about the extent of
the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it. This role also
included educating health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the
magnitude of the problem and the importance of self-policing and insuring the integrity of their
individual health care delivery systems. During 2001, nine presentations were conducted for 678
health care professionals and five presentations were conducted for 995 individuals in public
groups. 			
General Investigations Division (GID) 	
GID responds to complaints about violations that constitute Class 1, 2 and 3 felonies, 	
investigations are discretionary. Major emphasis is placed on responding to requests from the
Governor, Attorney General, commonwealth’s attorneys, grand juries and chiefs of police and
sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth. 		
A major priority of the GID is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement agencies.
Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state in order that
adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable time. The Division has 163
authorized positions, of which 132 are special agents actually assigned to conduct investigations.
The remaining 51 positions are supervisors and support personnel. During 2001, GID conducted
3,896 investigations, of which 1,214 or 31.2 percent of the total were a result of requests from
other enforcement agencies. Special agents made 2396 arrests. 	
GID headquarters personnel are responsible for the day-to-day coordination of investigations
occurring throughout the state and related administrative matters. Duties of headquarters
personnel also include the following:

Table: 15
Arson Investigation – A lieutenant is the chief arson investigator and coordinates activities
between the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other investigative agencies throughout the
state. Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by localities.
During 2001, the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in providing the following training
related to arson investigations and explosive related matters:
• 	A weeklong Arson Investigation School attended by investigators from statewide law
	enforcement, fire services and insurance agencies. 	
• 	Training sessions exclusively for local fire services departments in the recognition and
	detection of incendiary fires. 		
• 	Training sessions across the state for officers on handling bomb threats, bomb scene
	search techniques and suspected explosive devices.
• 	Explosives recognition and blast characteristics training and demonstrations for law
	enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, conferences and academies.
Within the Bureau there are a number of special agents who have been specifically trained to
investigate arson-related matters. Of the 3,896 GID investigations conducted by the Division in
2001, 133 were fire investigations of incendiary origin, 60 fire cases were investigated which were
found to be accidental and 162 more undetermined origin. 	
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 42 trained bomb technicians assigned to
the Division. During 2001, there were 112 actual explosive devices rendered safe and 206 hoax
and suspicious items requiring examination by bomb technicians. There were 468 explosives-
related incidents requiring the Division to respond and provide explosives-related expertise.
Bomb Technicians are continuing the 4-SAFE VA Program with a Bomb Threat
Presentation presented to school staff throughout the Commonwealth.
Auto Theft Unit – The Auto Theft Unit consists of a total of nine special agents assigned to
Richmond, Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake, Salem and Fairfax with a secretary
and a supervisor assigned to GID Headquarters. Members of the unit work closely with the
Department of Motor Vehicles, National Insurance Crimes Bureau, and federal and local law-
enforcement investigating crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and
other illegal activity. 			
In 2001, Auto Theft Unit members conducted 286 investigations, resulting in 77 arrests and the
recovery of 110 stolen vehicles with a value of $1,109,114. 	In addition, other stolen property with
a value of $169,200 was recovered. 	The vehicle identification numbers (VINs) of over 185
vehicles were verified. 			
Members of the Auto Theft Unit coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft
investigators and insurance company special investigative units across the Commonwealth of
Virginia. 	These meetings are held to discuss current automobile theft trends, and coordinate
enforcement efforts among law enforcement agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide
auto theft investigation training to numerous troopers and local law-enforcement officers at the
Virginia State Police Academy and regional academies throughout the course of the year.
The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Program Administrator is also a part of the Auto Theft Unit.
The HEAT Program is an insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-414 of
the Code of Virginia. 	The Program was established to create a “hotline” system to receive auto
theft related tips from citizens. 	Callers who provide information that leads to the arrest of
individuals for auto theft related crimes are eligible for a cash reward of up to $10,000.00.
Numerous awards have been paid over the past nine years, including several which have been
for the full amount of $10,000.

Table: 16
The HEAT Program provides funding in the form of grants to local law-enforcement agencies,
funding for enforcement training, prevention initiatives, and public awareness. 	Eight sworn
members and the secretarial position of the Auto Theft Unit are funded through the HEAT
program. 			
Crime Scene Examination – The Division is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the
Division of Forensic Science. The technicians are often called upon by other State Police
employees and by local law enforcement agencies to examine and evaluate evidence at the
crime scene. In 2001, 902 scenes were examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, arson,
burglary and numerous other major crimes. 	
Fugitive Apprehension Unit – The Fugitive Apprehension Unit is staffed with two special agents
at the Richmond, Chesapeake, and Fairfax offices. There is one agent stationed at the Culpeper,
Appomattox, Salem, and Wytheville offices and a supervisor at GID Headquarters.
The Unit’s mission is to effect the swift apprehension of all fugitives, particularly in connection
with violent crime. The Unit is mandated to work closely with local and federal law enforcement
agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2001, members were assigned 437 cases and arrested
421 fugitives. 			
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – This Unit is the result of a reorganization of the High
Technology Crimes Investigative (HTCIA), and the Accountants, consisting of seven high tech
agents and 23 accountants. The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) also is assigned to
GID. 			
The HTCIA opened 164 cases in 2001, involving a variety of investigations for this Department
and other local/federal agencies. The accountants concentrate on the investigations of white-
collar crime and in 2001 conducted 387 investigations. 	
Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) – CERU provides assistance to local, state and
federal law enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for computer-
related evidence, evidence recovery through forensic examination and quarterly training classes
in computer search and seizure. 			
In 2001, the CERU assisted with 62 investigations involving the seizure of 103 computers and
other related equipment. Thirty-three cases originated from state agencies, 29 from local
agencies. Types of violations and number of violations included: 	
Financial fraud 	10 	(16%)

Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – This Unit has 10 special agents assigned to field offices
around the state. Agents opened 78 cases in 2001 with 14 opened as a result of requests from
local law enforcement agencies.
One agent is assigned to the Unit to conduct criminal investigative analysis and assisted law
enforcement throughout Virginia with 20 cases involving homicides, sexual assaults, threat
assessments, equivocal death investigations and false allegations. This agent also presented 26
programs to law enforcement agencies on criminal investigative analysis, hostage negotiation,
school violence and workplace violence.
The Virginia Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) is under the Violent Crimes
Investigative Unit. During 2001, 12 homicide cases were entered into VICAP, bringing the total
cases in the system as of the end of the year to 678.
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 39 trained hostage negotiators available for
hostage or barricade situations. The negotiators trained on several occasions with the
Department of Corrections, local law-enforcement agencies and the State Police tactical teams.
Insurance Fraud Division (IFD)
Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved establishing an Insurance Fraud
Investigative Division within the Department of State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The
purposes of this Unit are threefold:
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the
	Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently
	being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent of such insurance
	fraud;
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state
	and local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units and
	any other person;
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud
	that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations.
IFD currently has 14 special agents located strategically throughout the state. Their primary focus
is on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2-178,
taking money under false pretenses. The law now requires that if insurance professionals have
reason to believe that someone is violating this statute, they are compelled to disclose this
information to the Department of State Police. Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking
auto crashes, staging burglaries, fraudulently reporting theft and Workers’ Compensation injuries.
The Division is constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently
receiving claim funds from insurance carriers.
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured citizen approximately $200 in
additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the cost of goods and
services. This Division is dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the
law-abiding citizens of Virginia. A hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected
insurance fraud has been established. The toll-free telephone number is:
	1-877-62FRAUD
Last year there were 140 calls received through the toll free hotline service. A reward program is
being considered to provide a reward for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of
individuals committing insurance fraud. An Internet web site has been established to provide
information on the various aspects of insurance fraud to the general public. This electronic
reporting system has been established whereby the insurance industry and the general public
can report incidents of suspected insurance fraud directly to the Insurance Fraud Division on line.

Investigative Results – During 2001, the Insurance Fraud Division received 1,012 notifications
of potential property and casualty insurance fraud from the insurance industry, law enforcement
agencies and the general public. There were 181 criminal investigations initiated resulting in 101
cases being prosecuted, which led to 118 criminal charges being placed for insurance fraud and
related offenses. The courts ordered almost $8 million in restitution during 2001.
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount
of claimed loss that was actually received by individuals submitting suspected insurance fraud
claims. During 2001, in cases handled by the Insurance Fraud Division, there was over $2 million
that was actually collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud. This was a reduction of
over $800,000 from the previous year that was not collected due to the efforts by the insurance
industry and law enforcement to prevent these losses. The total amount involved in suspicious
claims that was attempted, but not collected, held relatively constant at $4.5 million for 2001 from
$4.7 million in 2000. 		
BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 	
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000 miles of
state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	Uniformed State Police personnel provide
both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the ability of
local law enforcement to respond. 	The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety
Inspection Program, the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the
Special Operations Division. 		
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police services into
seven field divisions. 	These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one
or more cities and/or counties. 	Manpower is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and
county level. 		
Special Operations Division 	
The Special Operations Division was established on July 1, 2000, by the Virginia General
Assembly. 	The primary activities of this Division include highway narcotics interdiction,
surveillance of public transportation systems, and narcotic canine sweeps of parcels, schools,
and vehicles. 	The Division is also responsible for assisting local police departments in high
crime, drug-infested areas. 	
During 2001 two City/State Partnerships were conducted. 	
NEWPORT NEWS CITY/STATE PARTNERSHIP 	
January 2001 		
The Tidewater Interdiction Team, along with BFO Division 5, began a 90-day project on Sept. 18,
2000, in Newport News. 	After a one-week familiarization of the area, six Troopers and two
Sergeants began enforcement operations on Sept. 25, 2000. 	On Oct. 2, 2000, the Chief of
Police, Superintendent, Bureau of Field Operations Director and Division Commanders of the
Special Operations Division and Division Five conducted a community press release officially
beginning the operation. 		
The 90-day project in Newport News involving the Special Operations Division Tidewater
Interdiction Team, along with BFO Division 5, was completed in December. 	After meeting with
the Newport News Chief of Police, it was decided our limited assistance was extended for an
	18 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 19 of 24”
Table: 19
additional 90 days. 	The involvement will consist of periodic patrol projects in the problem areas
of the city in conjunction with the city police. 		
Total arrests made in 2001 through this initiative were 48 of which 38 were felony arrests and 10
