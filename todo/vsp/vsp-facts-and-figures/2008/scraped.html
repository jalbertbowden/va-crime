	THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT
	OF STATE POLICE 	
	ANNUAL REPORT 	
	2008 FACTS AND FIGURES
	SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 	
The Virginia Department of State Police is divided primarily into three Bureaus:
Administrative and Support Services, Criminal Investigation, and Field
Operations. 		
Each Bureau Director, who holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, reports directly
to the Deputy Superintendent. 		
The Superintendent’s Office includes the Executive Protective Unit, Professional
Standards Unit, the Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls,
and the Public Relations Office. 		
Professional Standards Unit 		
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs and staff
inspection functions within the Department of State Police. 	
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of
allegations of misconduct on the part of Department employees. 	During 2008,
638 internal investigations were processed. 		
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational
components within the Department, ensuring compliance with National
Accreditation Standards, OSHA requirements, and Department policies and
procedures. 	Six staff inspections were conducted in 2008. 	The Staff Inspection
Section also manages all records retention and destruction within the
Department. 		
Office of Performance Management and Internal
Controls 		
Established in March 2007, the Office of Performance Management and Internal
Controls (OPMIC) was created to track and monitor progress on the objectives
established in the Virginia Performs performance management system and to
ensure compliance with standards developed by central government oversight
agencies. 	OPMIC is also tasked with managing Agency Risk Management and
Internal Control Standards for the Department. 	OPMIC is comprised of the
Internal Audit Section and the Planning and Research Section. 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 2 of 52”
Table: 2
Internal Audit 	
Internal Audit performs audits and reviews of Virginia State Police operations for
the purpose of monitoring the agency’s performance in maximizing the efficiency
and effectiveness of Department operations and strengthening internal controls. 	
Internal auditors follow professional auditing standards and carry out the scope of
their work in an independent and objective manner. Results of all internal audits 	
are reported to management and the Superintendent, along with relevant 	
recommendations for improvement. Management then provides a response to 	
the audit report, which includes applicable corrective action plans. 	Some of the
common types of internal audits include: 	
• 	Review of the reliability of financial data and related financial reporting of 	
	operations 	
• 	Review of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures 	
• 	Audits of various operational areas or programs within the Department 	
• 	Reviews of the safeguarding of assets and the prevention/detection of losses,
	errors, or irregularities 	
• 	Audits of information technology systems and related security of data 	
• 	Investigations of State Employee Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Hotline complaint
	referrals 	
• 	Review or testing of the Department’s compliance with the Agency Risk 	
	Management and Internal Controls Standards (ARMICS) 	
Planning and Research 	
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all 	
divisions and units of the Department and is responsible for: 	
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies 	
• 	Updating staffing formulas 	
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management 	
	programs

During 2008, the Planning and Research Section administered 38 grants that 	
provided approximately $18.55 million in funding for agency projects. 	
Accreditation 	
In August 2007, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by
the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The 	
Department was fully compliant with the accreditation standards and received 	
many favorable reviews from the “public input” component of the evaluation. 	
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA,
as the Department, in 1985, became the second state law-enforcement agency 	
in the nation to receive official accreditation by CALEA. 	
Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for all accredited law 	
enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law 	
enforcement standards. 	In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven
agencies awarded a Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully 	
maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 	
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law 	
enforcement services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in 	
compliance with generally accepted standards. 	Accreditation requires a
comprehensive review of every aspect of the Department’s organization, 	
operations, and administration. 	
Public Relations Office 	
The Public Relations Office (PRO) is responsible for planning, developing, 	
managing and implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations
information and educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to
maintaining daily contact with the public and media, the PRO disseminates news
releases about Department programs and activities, traffic safety enforcement, 	
and crime prevention. The office also develops and implements highway safety 	
and public awareness media campaigns and conducts press interviews around 	
the state. 	
The PRO staff consists of a Public Relations Manager and two Public Relations 	
Coordinators at State Police Administrative Headquarters. The Public Relations 	
Office assists and supports the Department’s Public Information Officers (PIO) 	
assigned to each of the seven field divisions. PIO’s respond to the scenes of 	
major highway crashes, criminal incidents, and handle regional press inquiries in
order to assist the media in providing direct and timely information to the public. 	
In 2008, PRO and PIO accomplishments include:

• 	Deploying and operating emergency transportable wireless 	
	communications 	
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for 	
	mobile and fixed communications equipment. 	This includes
	VSP and all 21 public safety and public service agencies 	
	participating in the STARS network 	
• 	Manage, operate, and maintain the Computer Aided Dispatch 	
	(CAD) / Management Information System (MIS) / Mobile 	
	Management System 	
• 	Serve on the Statewide Interdepartmental Radio System (SIRS) 	
	board, and the Virginia Statewide Interoperability Executive 	
	Committee (SIEC) 	
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System 	
(STARS) Program Director by providing engineering, maintenance, 	
inventory control, asset management, configuration management, and 	
operations services. 	The Division also identifies and migrates the existing 	
State Police mobile data, land mobile and microwave radio networks that 	
will be upgraded to serve all of the Commonwealth’s state-level public 	
safety and service agencies. 	The STARS network is supported 24/7 by
the STARS network operations center (NOC). 	
The Communications Division is currently maintaining 320 legacy mobile 	
computer terminals (MCT) with commercial wireless CDMA 1X RTT 	
service for messaging; VCIN, NCIC and NLETS access; and 	
interoperability through terminal to terminal messaging with participating 	
agencies. 	The STARS project now being implemented is providing a 	
private data network with statewide geographical coverage currently to 	
which units can operate mobile computer terminals through the radio. 	
Legacy mobile data use has now been expanded to the entire I-81 corridor 	
and other secondary routes parallel to the interstate due to the increased 	
wireless coverage provided by the 1X RTT commercial technology. 	
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows 	
for rapid entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls 	
for service. 	The CAD system consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch 	
terminals, and over 100 remote access users. 	A total of 953,329 incidents
were entered into the CAD system in 2008. 	A total of 60,365 incidents
were created by Troopers using mobile computer terminals. 	A real time
data feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate rapid response to 	
incidents impacting traffic. 	
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) is a 	
database containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD 	
since March 1999. 	CAD historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. 	The
database currently holds in excess of six million records. 	An Intranet web
		6
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 7 of 52”
Table: 7
page allows VSP network users to create custom queries to obtain desired 	
data from the database. 	The web page also allows user access to weekly 	
and monthly reports. 	The MIS database allows the Department to track 	
and access information never before available, such as average response 	
times, total number of calls, and average workloads. 	
The Mobile Management System provides support for over 1,000 vehicle 	
terminals currently deployed. 	The users supported include troopers, other 	
state agencies, and local sheriffs’ offices and police departments. 	This
system allows user access to VCIN/NCIC, text messaging, and for the 	
troopers, full CAD functionality. 	
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative 	
Headquarters with new copper and fiber optic service. 	Telephone system
upgrades are continuing as needed at area offices and division 	
headquarters statewide. 		
In addition to mission-critical communications, the Communications 	
Division coordinates and supports wireless communications equipment 	
and services. 	The Division constantly monitors wireless services to 	
provide better coverage and increased technical support. 	This effort
supports the current mandated budget reductions with significant savings 	
to the Department of State police and the taxpayers in the 	
Commonwealth. 	These services make Department personnel more 	
accessible and keep them better informed regarding routine and 	
administrative activities. 	The number of wireless telephones approved 	
and in use has exceeded 1,100 units. 	Current cellular services will allow
the elimination of pagers in most areas of operations. 	
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary 	
systems for special events as they occur. 	
During 2008 events included: 		
1. 	Communications support for the NASCAR races held twice a year 	
	at Richmond International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway 	
2. 	Floydfest Musical Festival 	
All field division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by 	
the Division of Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating 	
2,800 radar tuning forks. 	The present inventory of active radars is 	
approximately 1,421 units and 108 lidar units. 	The majority of Department
radars are newer Golden Eagle II units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone services and wiring for local 	
area network wiring requirements for the Department and other state

agencies. 	At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of equipment are 	
being maintained for six additional agencies. 	The Division also continues
to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most of the 	
state’s public safety agencies. 	The Division will be responsible for over
60,000 items of STARS equipment for all participating agencies. 	Depot
level repair is performed in the Communications Division, a great savings 	
over all other alternatives. 	
The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital 	
Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly 	
PSWN) activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan 	
Washington, D.C., area. 	
The Communications Division serves as the Virginia’s Frequency Advisor 	
for the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO), the 	
Federal Communications Commission’s designated agent. 	The duties
include: 		
• 	Preparation of new and modified FCC license applications for 	
	localities and agencies throughout the Commonwealth as 	
	requested 	
• 	Coordinate applications processed through APCO headquarters 	
	with regards to spectrum efficiency, coverage needs, protection of 	
	Commonwealth incumbents, and conformance to regulations 	
• 	Review to accept or deny, applications processed through other 	
	coordinating agencies for protection of Commonwealth incumbents, 	
	and conformance to regulations 	
• 	Review to accept or deny, applications from states adjacent to the 	
	Commonwealth for interference protection of Commonwealth 	
	incumbents 	
• 	Represent the Commonwealth on Regional Planning Committees 	
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the 	
maintenance of all files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation,
monitoring, destruction, and archiving of records in accordance with the State 	
Police Records Retention Schedule. 	
In 2008, the Division processed and responded to 3,308 subpoenas and 353 	
Freedom of Information Act requests. 	
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 	
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 314,400 	
investigative reports in 2008, an increase of 3.6% from 2007.

Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 52”
Table: 9
Non-Criminal Justice Program (NCJ) 	
The Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 96,078 fingerprint based
searches and 284,006 name search requests for 2008. 	On February 8, 1996,
the Non Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant
growth and demand for criminal history record requests. 	The NCJI can be
accessed through the Department’s website. 	This interface eliminates the
requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process a high volume of “paper
record name-search” requests. 		
In 2008, CCRE staff processed 124,966 paper inquiries or 44% and 159,040 or
56% electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average
response time of 72 hours or less. 	Of the total paper record name search
requests, 74,704 inquiries were submitted on the bar-coded criminal history
request forms and the remaining 50,262 were submitted on the non bar-coded
forms. 	The bar coded method of automation has tremendously enhanced
customer service by reducing turn around time. 	
Mental Health File 		
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the
ability to purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these
categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an
individual (1) acquitted by reason of insanity, (2) involuntarily admitted to
inpatient or outpatient treatment, (3) adjudicated mentally incapacitated or
incompetent or (4) is the subject of a temporary detention order (TDO) and
agreed to voluntary admission. 	As of December 31, 2008, there were 16,042
mental health records added bringing the total records on file to 105,551.
Reviewing this file when an application to purchase is being processed has
prevented the transfer of a firearm in 136 instances in 2008. 	
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 	
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for
employment-licensure purposes had a slight increase. 	
9 	The SOR experienced a 5% increase. 	
9 	In 2008, there were 188,772 searches. 	
9 	An increase of 9,701 searches compared to 2007. 	
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular,
by providing personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals
convicted of certain sex crimes. 	Information regarding registered offenders
which includes a photograph is maintained on the internet. 	
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 17,843 fingerprint-based registrations
received since July 1, 1997. 		
9 	Fingerprint registrations grew 3% from 2007 to 2008.

Table: 10
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit 	
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit conducts criminal investigations related to 	
offenders required to register. 	In 2008, 3,300 criminal investigations were
initiated, which is a 9.3% decrease from 2007. 	
The Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual offenders. 	Registered offenders
require semi-annual address verification and an additional verification within 30
days of a change to their home or employment addresses information. 	During
2008, troopers confirmed 17,350 addresses which represent a 10.4% increase in
verifications from 2007. 	
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 	
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts, and 124
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE.
In 2008, an estimated 413,304 records were transmitted, negating the 	
requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE.
Of all dispositions transmitted, an estimated 14% were rejected. 	
In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented. 	
Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated
for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 	
For 2008, notifications for 26,759 individual charges were generated. 	The
majority of notifications (83%) were generated because the court did/could not 	
include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data. 	The
remaining notifications (17%) were generated when the court transmitted the 	
Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint
card on file. 	
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 	
As of December 31, 2008, there were 245,993 offenders on file with 	
commitments received from the Virginia Department of Corrections, which 	
accounts for 13.26% of the offenders on file. 	
The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information Interface
improved the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional 	
information with minimal error. 	
The Microfilm Section 	
This section archived 1,046,521 documents during 2008, an increase of 78,246
documents, or 8% since 2007. 	
Photographic Laboratory 	
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for 	
photographs, digital images, and court enlargements. 	Additionally, there were
	10
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 11 of 52”
Table: 11
122,875 photographic prints, a decrease of 7%, developed for use by sworn 	
personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal
cases in 2008. 	The lab also processed 231 compact discs (CD) due to digital 	
camera use. 		
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 	
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and palm
prints from criminal arrests, sex offenders and partial latent fingerprints recovered
from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are located at State
Police Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state and 	
local agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their 	
respective agencies. 	The Global Transaction Controller receives Live Scan 	
transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS
systems for searching existing criminal history records or to match latent 	
fingerprints against know criminal prints. 	The installation of the Electronic 	
Fingerprint Archive System has enhanced our ability to store and retrieve 	
fingerprint these records. 	Currently, there are 1,487,884 Virginia unique subject
related fingerprint files as part of AFIS. 		
There are 1,849,728 ten-print fingerprint records on file and 108,319 unsolved 	
latent fingerprints in the database. 	The Slap database has 562,477 images, the
Palm database has 28,967. 		
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest
information, including fingerprints and mugshots, to the State Police and the FBI.
This process enhances an agencies ability to detect aliases and outstanding 	
warrants on arrestees prior to their release. 		
Our agency is currently assisting the Department of Homeland Security and 	
Department of Justice by working with their agencies to enable local booking 	
agencies to pass biometric data to the FBI and ICE for the Secure Communities
initiative. 	This pilot program in Fairfax County, VA is targeting level 1 offenders 	
for removal. 		
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 		
Currently, there are 222 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 285 Live Scan units. 	In
addition, there were 99 Civil Live Scan sites utilizing 123 Live Scan Units. 	A total
of 59 criminal Live Scan sites are submitting criminal justice and concealed 	
weapon applicant information via Live Scan. 	The following is a brief comparison
of statistics.

* The drastic decrease in number of Criminal Live Scan sites and units was due
to the replacement of Live Scan terminals in 2007. 	During 2007, both live scan
units (old units and newly replaced units) were transmitting to VSP and were 	
counted. 	Additionally, the new replaced units and software allowed the criminal
sites to submit criminal justice applications electronically. 		
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 			
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except
antiques, based on the results of a criminal history record information check on
the buyer. 	The VFTP processed a record setting volume of gun transactions in
2008, specifically in the month of November with almost 40,000 transactions. 	A
total of 268,136 transactions were processed in 2008, which is the highest 		
volume of transactions processed in a calendar year since the beginning of the
program in 1989, and a 19% increase in transactions processed in 2007. 	Of 	
these, 2,777 were denied based on the result of a criminal history record 		
information check or other disqualifying record. 	During 2008, 126 wanted 		
persons were identified for extraditable offenses, which resulted in the arrest of
73 individuals wanted in Virginia, and the arrest of 4 individuals who were named
in an outstanding warrant from another state. 	In 2008, the State Police 		
requested 891 criminal investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to 	
purchase firearms. Additionally, during 2008, 810 criminal investigations for 	
illegal attempts to purchase firearms resulted in closed arrests. 		
VCheck 			
VCheck is Virginia’s Internet based Instant Background Check program, which
was introduced to all firearms dealers registered with the State Police Firearms
Transaction Center (FTC) on August 1, 2006. 	Approval numbers are generated
in instant clearances, while transactions that require review or research are 	
routed to the FTC for processing. 	During calendar year 2008, approximately 	
70% of the total transactions, statewide, were processed via the Internet. 		
As online users increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm trans- 	√
actions to research and verification processes. 	Additional employee time 		
devoted to these other processes provide more efficient overall services to the
firearm dealers and firearm purchasers and cost savings to the Department and
the Commonwealth.

A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of
a gun dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller
identification number for qualified employees. 	As of December 31, 2008, the
State Police issued 8,804 seller identification numbers.

Since July 1, 1995, 407,792 concealed handgun permits have been issued as 	
authorized by Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 55,864 were issued in 2008 	
(34.7% increase) by Virginia Circuit Courts. During 2008, 724 nonresident 	
concealed handgun permits were issued by the State Police, which is a 44% 	
increase in the volume of nonresident permits issued in 2007. 	
Pursuant to statute, the State Police enters the permit holder’s name and 	
description in the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) so that the 	
permit's existence and current status will be made known to law-enforcement 	
personnel accessing the Network for investigative purposes. 	As of December
31, 2008, there were 172,132 active concealed handgun permits issued by 	
Virginia circuit courts maintained in VCIN. 	
Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) 	
The Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) Section is responsible
for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing
law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different criminal offenses.
The UCR/IBR office no longer accepts summary hardcopy reports. 	Data is
submitted either by diskette or via the Internet. 	The diskettes and Internet files
are submitted through the IBR Web site. 	This is a secure system to which only
State Program personnel and contributing agencies have access. 	Each day
submitted files are run through the edit process. 	This procedure generates an
error report so that agencies may correct any incidents that failed to be sent to 	
the IBR central repository database. 	A monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated
and emailed to the National Program (FBI) for inclusion in their annual 	
publication, Crime in the United States. 	
During 2008, the UCR/IBR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with 	
training issues, interpretation of error reports, and clarifications in offense 	
definitions and reporting procedures, as well as assisted computer software 	
vendors with reporting issues. 	
There are 18 private vendors with software that transforms agency crime data 	
into an approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their
own in-house software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly reports are now posted
on the IBR Web site rather than having to be mailed to each contributing agency.
The UCR/IBR office responded daily to multiple requests for crime statistics from
state agencies, government officials, students, media, and the general public. 	
	13

Table: 14
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter, the annual report, 	
Crime in Virginia, and distributed to contributing agencies. 	Commonwealth’s
Attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state agencies are also informed of the
availability of this information. 	In 2004, the annual report was published for the
first time on a CD rather than hardcopy. 	Beginning in 2007, the annual report will
only be available through the State Police Web site. 	This report contains
reported Group A offenses by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A
and Group B arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	The data is used for law
enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and legislative implementation.
The IBR contributing agency Web site went into production in 2002. 	Currently,
there are 282 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through
the Internet. 	This Web site provides law enforcement agencies with the
convenience of on-line monthly data submission, receiving timely error 	
notifications, monthly and year-to-date statistical reports, performing searches
and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals, bulletins, and posting inquiries in the 	
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. 	
The 2008 offenses and arrest data will be available in the middle of April. 	
Through grant funding, the front-end of the IBR Web site has been changed to
allow agencies to submit monthly files for editing so they may correct rejected 	
incidents before sending data to Virginia’s IBR central repository. 	Reformatting
of IBR manuals and development of online training modules are currently under
development. 	The Department will seek additional funding to complete additional
phases of the improvement project. 	
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information
Center (NCIC) 	
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 683 member agencies with 10,655 	
terminals, an increase of 166 terminals, a slight increase over the number of 	
terminals in 2007. 	The system is used by 28,801 certified operators in various
criminal justice agencies. 	Of these terminals, there are 3,312 non-mobile
terminals. 	
This number has remained stable over the past year. 	Mobile terminals have
increased to 7,509 from 7,457. 	In 2008, VCIN processed approximately
374,649,384 transactions (a decrease of 7% of the 2007 totals) between 	
NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state computer databases. 	
The decrease is the result in the “New Hotfiles” system which now can transmit
multiple searches of files in one transmission back to the requester. 	This system
processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three seconds. 	
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC 	
system, which is critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these
systems store information relating to wanted persons, missing persons, and 	
stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia information relating to
48,096 wanted persons (less than 1% decease as compared to 2007), 1915 	
	14
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 15 of 52”
Table: 15
missing adults, 14111 missing children, and 13,492 stolen vehicles. 	As of 	
December 31, 2008, the active numbers of Protective Orders on file were: 	858
Emergency Protective Orders, 2,459 Preliminary Orders, and 19,890 Orders of
Protection. 			
In February of 2008, the new VCIN Wanted “Hotfiles” System was implemented.
Some of the advantages of the new files are allowing agencies with access to a
query page that has the look and feel of a web page through Messenger. 	The
query page will allow each VCIN user to view a current list of his/her agency’s
outstanding warrants, missing persons, protective orders, felony/stolen 		
vehicles/license plates/parts, and towed/abandoned vehicles. 	The new file has
also enhanced VCIN Protective Order transactions to be more compatible with
NCIC. 			
Law enforcement agencies were given the opportunity to acquire one free two
year license of the new OpenFox Messenger software as part of the VCIN Image
Project Grant. 	The project is designed to enable law enforcement agencies to
use the application to receive and send images through an existing Virginia
Criminal Information Network (VCIN) terminal. 	As of January 1, 2009, 361 law
enforcement agencies have accepted and installed the new OpenFox Messenger
program. 			
E-Magistrate 			
The Supreme Court of Virginia now has an automated interface called E- 		
Magistrate that is now being used in several pilot test sites locations through out
the state. 	This interface permits felonies and misdemeanor warrants and 		
Emergency Protective Orders issued by magistrates to be presented to VCIN
terminals for acknowledgement and entry from into VCIN and NCIC. 	This is a
similar interface from the Courts Management Information System currently
being used by the courts enter Preliminary Protective Orders and Final Orders of
Protection. 	In 2009, this automated interface will come on-line for all law 		
enforcement agencies obtaining warrants from magistrates in their jurisdictions.
The interface works as follows: 		
• 	Within 30 minutes of issuance of the warrant or protective order, a VCIN
	message will be generated by the VCIN hot files interface to the terminal
	for the law enforcement agency that is consistent with that jurisdiction and
	speeds the data entry required for to make it available to all law 		
	enforcement agencies. 		
This new interface is going to provide a benefit to Virginia law enforcement and
speed the entry of warrants and protective orders into VCIN and NCIC. 	After
receipt of a document, charging a person with a felony or violation of §18.2-
472.1, appropriate wanted information will be immediately entered into the NCIC
and VCIN systems (excluding juvenile petitions unless the juvenile will be tried as
			15
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 52”
Table: 16
an adult and any felony documents that will be served within the 24 hours). 	As a
result of the new interface, Virginia agencies will now have this information 	
available for entry within 30 minutes of the magistrate issuing and entering the 	
warrant or Emergency Protective Order into the Supreme Court of Virginia E- 	
Magistrate System. 	As another benefit, this functionality will reduce data entry 	
required by staff. 		
Availability of Department of Motor Vehicle Images via VCIN 	
Virginia DMV images are available to Virginia law enforcement agencies through
the Virginia State Police, Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) using the
OpenFox Messenger application. 	Alternatively, they will be available to interface
agencies that have completed the programming to their VCIN interface as 	
advised. 	Since April of 2008, the VCIN system as processed 35,700 images 	
requests from law enforcement agencies for DMV Images. 		
Additionally, DMV images are available through NLETS from other participating
states. 	Currently, the states of Tennessee and North Carolina are the most 	
prevalent recipients of Virginia photos and the states that Virginia users request
the most often. 		
Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse 		
Virginia Amber Alert System 		
A new system was developed in March 2006 to automate the entry and 	
notification process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 	The system is designed to
provide a comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the
safe recovery of a child and capture of the abductor. 	Local law enforcement 	
agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request form, enter the 	
information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 	The system has
significantly reduced the time required to get this information out to the public. 	
In 2008, seven requests were received for AMBER ALERT. Two of the requests
met the criteria and activated. 	In some cases in which the criteria were not met
an Endanger Missing Child Media Alert was offered as an alternative to the 	
requesting law enforcement agency. 	Eight of these alerts were activated. 	
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse has also joined efforts
with the U.S. Department of Justice to educate Virginia’s fifth grade students 	
about safety issues through a national poster contest with a theme of “Bring Our
Missing Children Home.” 	Ms. Jordan Simon, a 5 th grade student from Hebrew 	
Academy of Tidewater in Virginia Beach, Virginia was recognized as the 2008 	
winner. 	In 2009, the contest will be conducted again, with the Department 	
submitting the Virginia winner for a national judging competition by the 	
Department of Justice. 	If they win the national competition, the artwork will 	
become the theme for all DOJ Missing Children publications in 2010.

Virginia Senior Alert Program 	
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia Assembly created the Virginia
Senior Alert Program. 	This program, managed by the Criminal Justice
Information Service Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police to
publicize an incident of a missing senior adult. 	When activated, the information is
publicized at www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our media partners. 	
In 2008, the Senior Alert process was activated on five occasions. 	
Finance 	
The Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial functions, including
the preparation of, monitoring, and accounting for the Department’s annual 	
budget of in excess of $286,000,000 for 2008, including approximately 	
$11,500,000 of federal grants. 	
The Finance Division processes payments to vendors in accordance with 	
established policies and procedures issued by various entities, including, but not
limited to the State Department of Accounts and Federal agencies. 	Payments
are processed in compliance with the “Prompt Payment Act.” 	
Security, patrol services and background information is routinely provided to 	
other state agencies, localities and private entities for which the Department 	
seeks reimbursement. 	The Finance Division, along with other Divisions of the
Department, bills for these services provided by the Department. 	It is the
responsibility of the Finance Division to collect the receivables and record 	
deposits to the proper accounts, as well as seek alternative solutions to collect 	
on bad debt. 	
The Finance Division is responsible for seized asset accounting and case 	
management for drug related seizures in accordance with applicable state and 	
federal guidelines and reporting requirements. 	The Finance Division is also
charged with managing the recently award $44 million settlement related to the
Purdue Pharmaceutical case. 	
The Finance Division prepares all state and federal reporting in compliance with
applicable State and Federal regulations, working with the State Auditor of Public
Accounts and Federal auditors. 	Along, with VSP’s Office of Performance
Management and Internal Controls (OPMIC), the Finance Division ensures the 	
Department’s compliance with the Agency Risk Management and Internal 	
Control Standards (ARMICS).

Information Technology Division 		
The Information Technology Division (IT) provides the computer infrastructure in
support of Virginia State Police's public safety mission and services to the 	
citizens of the Commonwealth. 	The IT Division is responsible for many mission
critical systems and applications which support local, state, and federal law 	
enforcement efforts. 		
Automated Fingerprint Processing 		
In 2008, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 408 systems in 321 local law
enforcement and civil applicant agencies. 	More than 279,450 arrest fingerprints
were electronically transmitted to State Police in 2008 from local law enforcement
agencies. This represents 92.5% of the arrest volume in Virginia. 	Approximately
90% of the arrests received electronically at State Police were processed without
manual intervention. 		
In 2008, almost 187,000 applicant prints were processed through the automated
applicant system, which reduces the turnaround time from months to days. 	Of
these applicant requests, 73.5% were initiated at Live Scan devices and were
processed with minimal manual intervention. 		
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 		
In 2008, VCIN processed over 374 million transactions. 	This decrease of 7%
from the previous year is the result of the implementation of the new Hot Files
system. 	With its implementation, hot files combined multiple file searches into a
single response to the requesting agency. 		
On September 30, 2008, the NISP (NLETS Interstate Sharing of Photos) project
was placed into VCIN production to provide DMV photos to requesting agencies.
The number of requested photos has gone from 8,518 in its first full month, to
almost double that amount in January 2009 (15,442). 	This should increase 	
substantially as larger law enforcement agencies throughout Virginia program
their applications to accept the photo format. 		
A new IBM p5 series server was installed at the Disaster Recovery site in Salem.
This new server will allow for a more seamless transition should it be needed to
assume the duties of the VCIN production environment. 	Successful transactions
have been sent to NCIC, NLETS and CCH. 		
Firearms System VCheck (Virginia’s Instant Background Check) 	
In 2008, 630 firearms dealers used the VCheck automated instant background
check system. 	The Virginia Firearms Transaction Center (FTC) processed a
record setting volume of gun transactions in 2008; a total of 268,136 transactions
		18
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 19 of 52”
Table: 19
were processed, which is the highest volume of transactions processed in a
calendar year since the beginning of the program in 1989, and a 19% increase in
transactions processed during 2007. 	In addition, the monthly transaction record
was set in November with almost 40,000 transactions. 	Of the 2008 firearms
transactions processed, 70% were directly by dealers using VCheck. 	The other
30% of firearms transactions were processed by FTC call takers who used
VCheck to initiate the background check. 		
In 2008, the functionality was provided to all allow the FTC administrator to
manage the information displayed to dealers via the VCheck Home page. 	In
addition, enhancements were made to VCheck to allow dealers who sell firearms
at gun shows to select the specific gun show (instead of the jurisdiction of the
gun show) where the transaction occurred; this change has eliminated the dealer
confusion associated with selecting the jurisdiction of the gun show. 		
Hot Files (replacement for Wanted System) 		
The Hot Files system was implemented on January 14, 2008. 	This system
provides all of the same functionality of the Wanted system with enhancements
to support the entry of misdemeanor as well as felony wanted persons, entry and
display of images, direct access to agency records, online validation, and an
interface with the Virginia courts to automatically receive protective orders.
Reports are generated electronically and distributed by email. 		
Over 105,800 wanted persons were entered in 2008. 	Of the 62,000 total 	
protective orders, over 16,600 were received directly from the courts. 	Over 7400
images were entered in 2008. 		
Sex Offender Registry (SOR) 		
VSP public sex offender website was redesigned in 2008. 	The web site now
provides live data to the public in addition to improved features. 	The Sex 	
offender system was also enhanced to accept photos of offenders from DMV.
During 2008, VSP processed 3,443,884 records from DMV; 590,148 records
from higher education institutions. 	VSP processed 17,350 sex offender 	
verifications and DOC processed 10,661 verifications. 		
Palm Print System 		
By the end of 2008, at least 18 live scan units were installed in local law 	
enforcement agencies around the state having the ability of taking and submitting
palm prints with criminal arrest records.

Personnel Division 		
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource 	
management with continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and 	
diversifying the Department’s work force. 		
Recruitment Unit 		
The Recruitment Unit Recruiters gave a combined 757 programs at selected 	
sites in 2008 to generate a qualified and diverse applicant pool. 		
• 	Recruiters continue to attend minority and female colleges and universities to
	locate prospective applicants. 	Recruiting Lunchbox formats are continuing
	to be used on university and college campuses within their divisions. 	Each
	Recruiter conducted a minimum of three programs per month. 	This recruiting
	technique continues to provide the Department with a diverse pool of 	
	candidates and is furthering a relationship with the diverse university 	
	population we recruit. 	A total of 227 lunchbox events were conducted in
	2008. 		
• 	Recruiters have been actively recruiting at local Civic, Women’s and 	
	Minority group venues in an effort to facilitate recruiting minority candidates.
	This has been established in order to provide recruiting campaigns when 	
	these groups are holding festivals and to directly work with minority 	
	organizations to develop a rapport to facilitate recruitment efforts. 	Recruiters
	are participating in a minimum of three programs per month. 	These groups 	
	continue to provide valuable contact information within their organization and
	the community. 	The following organizations have been very helpful in 	
	assisting our Department with our recruiting efforts: 	NAACP, NOBLE, Virginia
	Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Radio Richmond Multi-Cultural Community,
	St. Paul’s Baptist Church, and the National Organization of Women (NOW).
	A total of 216 civic/women’s/minority events were conducted in 2008. 	
• 	Military Recruitment – Each Recruiter provides one program per month
	to transitioning military personnel. 	Virginia has the most military facilities
	of any state in the nation, and the military offers a very diverse candidate 	
	pool. 	A total of 100 military events were conducted in 2008. 	
• 	Recruiters continued to identify Student Athlete Recruiting to further our 	
	minority and female recruitment. 	Recruiters visited athletic/health facilities
	in assigned divisions to actively recruit with emphasis on women and 	
	minorities. 	A total of 68 student athlete events were conducted in 2008.
• 	Career Sessions/Public Safety Day events were held in Wytheville, 	
	Culpepper and Salem in 2008. 	These sessions provided a regional venue to
	recruit as well as showcase our Department to the community. 	Each event 	
	was attended by many prospective applicants and citizens. 	The events 	
			20
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 21 of 52”
Table: 21
	received positive publicity through statewide radio coverage. 	Due to the
	budget shortfall, only 18 job fairs were conducted at no cost to the 	
	Department. 		
• 	Other Recruitment Efforts: 	128 programs were conducted at the request of
	other agencies and vendors throughout the state.

Employment Section 				
There were no trooper trainees hired in 2008. 	Seven Trooper IIs and one
Special Agent were rehired during 2008, and 12 Commercial Vehicle 	
Enforcement Officers were hired for the 32nd CVEO Basic School which began
on December 10, 2008. 				
The Employment Section advertised 264 civilian positions (156 full-time and 108
wage) throughout 2008. 	This is a 44.7% decrease in the 382 positions 	
advertised in 2007. 	The total number of applicants who applied in 2008 was
4,346 (2,552 full-time and 1,794 wage). 	This is an 11.6% increase in the 3,895
applications received during 2007. 		
The Employment Section processed 19 grievances during 2008, a decrease of
11 from 2007. 	There were 44 written notices processed, a decrease of 34.1%
from the 59 written notices processed in 2007. 	Two Equal Employment 	
Opportunity (EEO) complaints were filed in 2008 (2 federal and 0 state),
compared to 2 (1 federal and 1 state) filed in 2007. 	
During 2008, 76 volunteers gave 7,880 hours of their time in locations throughout
the state. 	This is an increase of four volunteers and 108 volunteer hours of
service from 2007. 	In April, a volunteer recognition event was held to thank our
					22
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 23 of 52”
Table: 23
involved citizens who work to make the community a better place. 	According to
the Independent Sector research, the estimated dollar amount of volunteer time
for 2007, the latest computation, is $19.51 per hour. 	Using these figures, our
volunteers contributed time valued over $153,738.00 to the Department.
The Employment Section continues to provide training to Department supervisors
and employees on Workplace Harassment, Workplace Violence, and Grievance
Procedures. 	All new employees receive a comprehensive orientation, which
provides a broad overview of the operation of the Virginia State Police, the
procedures and policies that guide the agency including performance 	
expectations, compensation, and benefits. 	Education and training to all
employees continues to prove to be very successful. 	There were no complaints
of workplace harassment or workplace violence in 2008. 		
Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section (CCTR)
During the 2008 year, the CCTR Section processed 934 personnel actions in the
Personnel Management Information System. 	The attached document specifies
the transactions. 	These transactions do not include the high volume of address,
telephone numbers, email, and name changes. 	The State Police Salary Plan
was updated. 		
A large number of employment history and verification requests were also
processed by telephone and in completing forms. 	We responded to 45 	
subpoenas, four FOIA requests, 44 requests for purchase of individual firearms,
100 outside employment requests, and several legal inquiries. 	Additionally, 216
inactive personnel files will be pulled from our inactive shelves, prepared and
microfilmed. 	We average seven requests a week to pull files for managers,
background investigators, and outside parties. 	Also, history cards must be
completed for all employees leaving the agency. 	Finally, we record all 	
educational records. 		
Several reports are developed on a routine basis such as military leave,
resignations from the Department, and salary/work title sorts as a tool for
management. 	We are also testing the automated Alternate Work Schedule
Program. 	A report function needs to be added to the database. 	We received
over 400 updated EWPs by email for review and filing. 	We also resolved dozens
of payroll issues in tandem with the Finance Division and Payroll Service Bureau.
The Payroll Service Bureau is independent from the State Police and is not on
site. 		
We are participating along with other agencies with DHRM’s initiative for
automation of personnel practices in State Government. 	The first goal is to
establish an automated time and attendance program for all agencies. 	
The CCTR Section also completed a classification study of 142 positions in CJIS.
We also resolved several overpayment issues related to military leave. 	We
received, audited and processed 27 classification requests for full-time positions
		23
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 24 of 52”
Table: 24
and 11 wage positions. 	We responded to five salary surveys. 	We also reviewed
and responded, as necessary, to all probationary performance reviews. 	We also
are working to match our position information in PMIS to CIPPs and MAPPER. 	
The agency is taking a fiscal approach to placement of positions for budgeting 	
purposes. 		
CCTR also maintained all Weight Control Records on all sworn personnel, 	
central Personnel Records, all Background Records, all Position Files and 	
selected Medical Files for the Department. 	Additionally, this section reviewed 	
and processed all VEC inquiries, processed employees entering and returning 	
from military service, and analyzed and returned explanations for audit 	
exceptions reports concerning all pay transactions. 		
The section reviewed and processed 2,556 Performance Evaluations for 2008,
which 927 were rated as extraordinary contributors, 969 major contributors, 632
Contributors, seven Marginal Contributors, one below Contributor, and 20 	
evaluations were not completed due to LWOP issues. 	Wage employees were 	
also updated for the next cycle. 		
Property and Logistics Division 		
The Property and Logistics Division encompasses a wide range of 	
property management and logistical functions. 	It was responsible for the 	
procurement, warehousing, and distribution of more than $28,631,156 in 	
supplies and equipment in 2008. 	The Property and Logistics Division is 	
also responsible for the management and maintenance of 115 buildings 	
and grounds across the state. 		
The State Police Administrative Headquarters Building Renovation project 	
is under way and will be completed in early 2009. 		
The Department is proceeding with design documents for the construction 	
of a new 14,000 SF garage facility at headquarters complex. 	The 	
Department is also developing design documents for the construction of a 	
Public Safety Driver Training facility at Fort Pickett. 		
The Property and Logistics Division oversees the mailroom and printing 	
sections, which processed 289,241 pieces of mail during 2008, and 	
printed 4,745,366 copies. 	It also manages the garage, which is 	
responsible for equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately 2,500 	
vehicles. 		
The Property and Logistics Division has the responsibility for the Virginia 	
Excess Military Property Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement 	
agencies to procure, at no cost, military property and equipment that is in 	
		24
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 25 of 52”
Table: 25
excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is
appointed by the Governor as the point of contact, and provides a state
coordinator. 	The program serves over 250 Virginia law enforcement
agencies and in 2008 the program distributed goods valued over
$1,840,000.dollars. 	
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-
to-day operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement
Program, “The 1122 Program.” 	This program allows state and local law
enforcement agencies to purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for
counter-narcotic activities through the federal procurement channels at
substantial savings. 	During 2008, over $975,784 was purchased through this
program, saving the Department $338,075. 	
Training Division 	
During 2008, the Training Division ensured that all employees met mandated
training requirements. 	The Virginia State Police Academy provided 9,075 hours
of instruction in 343 sessions for 7,540 employees and 1,550 employees from
outside agencies. 	Fifty-nine trooper trainees, two commercial vehicle

week school for a total of 9,200 hours. 	
In 2008, three basic canine schools (one explosive, one narcotic, and one 	
bloodhound) were conducted for a total of 1,560 hours of training at the Training
Academy. 	Two Explosives Canine Trainer Schools were conducted for a total of
1,040 hours of training. 	Handlers from Virginia State Police, Virginia Tech, and
Petersburg Police Department were trained. 	Two trainers were certified from
Virginia State Police. 	A total of 10 canine teams and two canine trainers
graduated. 	
Academy facilities were utilized by several outside agencies, including the 	
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Department of Criminal Justice 	
Services, Department of Juvenile Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug
Enforcement Administration, and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
These 70 sessions provided 3,166 hours of instruction to 83 Department 	
employees and 1,552 outside students. 	
BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 	
	The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive
	investigation of all criminal matters mandated by statute and
	established Department policy through the Bureau of
	Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is mandated to
	investigate any matter referred by the Governor.
	Additionally, the Attorney General, Commonwealth’s
	Attorneys, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs and Grand Juries may
	request the Department to investigate matters, which
	constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts
	investigations of elected officials when directed by the
	Governor, Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau
	consists of the Criminal Intelligence Division, Support
	Services Division, Drug Enforcement Section, and the
	General Investigation Section.
General Investigation Section (GIS) 	
GIS responds to all complaints referred by the Governor and other complaints 	
that constitutes a Class 1, 2 or 3 felony. Other requests for investigations are 	
discretionary but major emphasis is placed on responding to requests from the 	
	26
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 27 of 52”
Table: 27
Attorney General, Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Grand Juries, Chiefs of Police
and Sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth. 	
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law
enforcement agencies. Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic
locations throughout the state to ensure that adequate response can be made to
any location in a reasonable time. 	
During 2008, GIS conducted 3,634 investigations, of which 1,596, or 44%,
resulted from requests from other law enforcement agencies. GIS Special Agents
made a total of 2,825 arrests. 	
Crime Scene Examination – The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians
trained by the Division of Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called
upon by other State Police employees and by local law enforcement agencies to
examine and evaluate evidence at crime scenes. 	In 2008, 282 scenes were
examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, burglary, and numerous other major
crimes. 	
Fugitive Apprehension – The Fugitive Apprehension mission is to affect the
swift apprehension of all fugitives, particularly in connection with violent crimes.
Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension work closely with local and federal law
enforcement agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2008, members were
assigned 520 cases and made 527 arrests. 	
Polygraph – During 2008, State Police polygraph examiners conducted 569
criminal polygraphs and 149 administrative/pre-employment polygraph
examinations. 	
Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – During 2008, this unit investigated 378
cases which included 233 requests from other agencies. 	A total of 194 arrests
were recorded for the year. 	These crimes included homicide, rape, robbery and
sex crimes. 	
The Violent Crimes Investigative Unit conducted 47 case profiles for the year for
the Department and for other federal and local law enforcement agencies. The
unit also presented 69 training programs relating to homicides, sex crimes and
hostage negotiations. 	
Crisis Negotiators – During 2008, these specialty agents responded to 23
barricaded subject situations. 	
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – The Cyber Crime Unit opened 351 cases in
2008, involving a variety of investigations for this Department and other local and
federal agencies.

Table: 28
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant, who is assigned to the Support Services 	
Division, is the chief arson investigator and coordinates activities between the 	
Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other investigative agencies throughout the
state. 		
Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by 	
localities. 	During 2008, the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in 	
providing the following training related to arson investigations and explosives 	
related matters: 	
. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling
	bomb threats, bomb scene search techniques and suspected explosive
	devices. 	
. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and
	blast characteristics for law enforcement and fire service personnel in 	
	seminars, conferences, and academies. 	
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been 	
specifically trained to investigate arson-related matters. 	In 2008, GIS conducted
410 fire scene investigations 	
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 32 trained bomb 	
technicians assigned to the GIS. 	In 2008, there were 251 explosives-related
incidents requiring the GIS to respond and provide explosives-related expertise.
During 2008 there were 62 hoax and suspicious items requiring examination by
bomb technicians. 	
Bomb technicians continue to present bomb threat presentations to school staffs
throughout the Commonwealth. 	
Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents are
funded by the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program. 	These Special
Agents work closely with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the National
Insurance Crimes Bureau, and federal and local law enforcement agencies to 	
investigate crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and 	
other illegal activity. 	
In 2008, the Special Agents conducted 165 motor vehicle theft investigations, 	
resulting in 45 arrests and the recovery of 66 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy
equipment with a combined value of $1,209,062. They also conducted 112 	
vehicle ID verifications for other federal, state, and local law enforcement 	
agencies. 		
Auto Theft Agents coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft 	
investigators and insurance company special investigative units across the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These meetings are held to discuss current
		28
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 29 of 52”
Table: 29
automobile theft trends and coordinate enforcement efforts among law 	
enforcement agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide auto theft 	
investigation training to numerous Troopers and local law-enforcement officers at
the Virginia State Police Academy and regional academies. 		
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.)
Program is an insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-
414 of the Code of Virginia. 	The Program was established in 1992 to receive
and reward auto theft related tips. 	Callers who provide information that leads to
the arrest of individuals for auto theft related crimes become eligible for cash
rewards. 	On January 1, 2004 the maximum reward increased from $10,000 to
$25,000. 	Seven full $10,000 rewards were paid to callers before this increase
took effect. 	During 2008, one Charlotte County citizen was awarded $1,700 and
three Fairfax County citizens were awarded H.E.A.T. rewards totaling $20,000 by
helping the police. 		
The Department’s H.E.A.T. Program provides leadership to over 175 state and
local police and sheriff agencies working cooperatively to reduce auto theft 	
throughout Virginia. 	H.E.A.T. personnel support auto theft reduction efforts by
providing training, conducting promotional events, conducting prevention/VIN
Etching events, offering grant funding, procuring specialized equipment, 	
coordinating monthly meetings of regional auto theft investigators, providing 	
Department of Motor Vehicles’ documentation to support prosecutions and by
assembling auto theft statistical information. 	Since 2003, over 525 title searches
were completed for auto theft investigators in the United States and Canada.
H.E.A.T. conducts two basic and one advanced auto theft investigation school for
law enforcement annually. 	H.E.A.T. and the Virginia Crime Prevention 	
Association cooperatively present auto theft prevention instruction to crime 	
prevention specialists and Operation HEATWave Coordinators 4 to 5 times per
year. To enhance Virginia’s auto theft investigative abilities, the H.E.A.T. office
provides training scholarships totaling $25,000 each year to send auto theft 	
investigators from local law enforcement agencies to receive specialized training
conducted by the International Association of Auto Theft Investigators. 	The
H.E.A.T. office also supported the production of five bait cars that will be 	
employed in high theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 	Mobile
Data Hunter vehicles have also been deployed throughout the state to locate
stolen vehicles. 		
The H.E.A.T. Program works with Neathawk Dubuque and Packett, a private
marketing agency, to increase the public’s awareness about the problem of auto
theft, auto theft prevention devices and strategies, the H.E.A.T. Program, the
H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-HEAT) and cash rewards of up to $25,000. 	Citizens
are directed to the H.E.A.T. Web Site at: www.heatreward.com, for additional
H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The public is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT
(4328) if they ever learn of any auto theft related information. 	In addition, 	
		29

Table: 30
H.E.A.T. promotional messages run throughout Virginia on television, radio,
billboards, newspapers and on three NASCAR race cars.
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted
in a momentous reduction in Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s
motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately
34%. 	Working together to protect cars by employing the “Layered Approach to
Protection” and educating the public regarding the toll-free hotline to increase tips
has proven to be an effective strategy to make Virginia a safer place to own and
operate a motor vehicle. 	
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly
approved establishing an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the
Department of State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigation. In 2003, the
General Assembly lifted the sunset clause making the Insurance Fraud Program
a permanent unit of the Department. The purposes of this Unit are threefold:
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when
	the Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or
	is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent
	of such insurance fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by
	federal, state and local police, other law-enforcement authorities,
	governmental agencies or Units, and any other person;
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of
	suspected fraud that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation;
	and conduct the investigations. 	
Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging
burglaries, fraudulently reporting theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation
injuries. The IFP is constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed
at fraudulently receiving claim funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has
a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of
claimed loss that was actually received by individuals submitting suspected
insurance fraud claims. During 2008, more than $3,100,000 was actually
collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud and the total amount
involved in suspicious claims that was attempted, but not collected, was over
$9,000,000. 	
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as
$1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services. This Program is dedicated
		30
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 31 of 52”
Table: 31
to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens
of Virginia. The hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected 	
insurance fraud receives frequent activity. The toll-free telephone number is: 1-
877- 62FRAUD. (1-877-623-7283) 	
In 2008, 1,951 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward
program has been established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for 	
individuals having a Sharp Eye and reporting information leading to the arrest
and/or conviction of individuals committing insurance fraud. IFP operates the 	
reward program by use of the insurance fraud hotline and through information
obtained during investigations and provided by the general public. A reward 	
committee has been selected to make recommendations based on written policy
and procedures. Their recommendations are forwarded through channels to the
Superintendent for final approval. 	The Insurance Fraud Program has paid out
$48,750 in rewards to those individuals that have a “Sharp Eye” and reported 	
insurance fraud. 	
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of
insurance fraud to the general public, law enforcement, the insurance industry
and media. 	A portion of the Web site provides the insurance industry and the
general public the capability to report incidents of suspected insurance fraud 	
directly to the Insurance Fraud Program on line. This service is available through
the Department’s Web site and www.stampoutfraud.com 	
The Special Agents assigned to investigate insurance fraud have a primary focus
of fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate 	
Section 18.2-178, obtaining money under false pretense, which was amended by
the General Assembly in 2006. 	The amended code establishes venue for
prosecuting the crime of obtaining money by false pretense. 	This means that for
crimes committed after July 1, 2006, the person charged with obtaining money by
false pretense can be tried in one of two places – the jurisdiction in which the 	
person lived when the crime was committed or in the jurisdiction where the crime
was actually committed. 	
During 2008, 1,924 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance 	
fraud were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and
the general public. There were 808 criminal investigations initiated by the Special
Agents and 369 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. 	Four hundred
twenty-two insurance fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court- 	
ordered restitution of $1,277,921 during 2008.

Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 	
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and
substance abuse laws. The Section remains committed to its support of local law
enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional
field offices also help in this effort by supporting special operations initiated by
other law enforcement entities. 	
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and
civilian support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 	
• DES Regional Field Offices 	
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 	
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 	
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 	
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 	
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 	
In 2008, DES field offices participated in 5,532 investigations that yielded
$22,765,921 in seized narcotics, $5,300,557 in seized currency, and 2048
persons arrested on 3,110 felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 2,050
persons were arrested on 1,480 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases
where DES assisted other agencies. 	Special Agents also seized 55 vehicles and
597 weapons. 	Additionally, 61 meth lab safety programs were delivered and 22
actual meth labs were dismantled. 	
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – During 2008, DES participated in 35 state
and local multi-jurisdictional task forces, encompassing 120 local jurisdictions.
These multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 5,522 investigations that
accounted for $18,302,532 in illicit drug seizures, $3,313,144 in seized U.S.
currency, and 3,036 persons arrested on 3,974 charges. 	These task forces also
seized 66 vehicles and 384 weapons. 	
Marijuana Eradication Program – The Commonwealth remains a prime
location for the cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown
marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop. With DEA funding, the
Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local law
enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard Reconnaissance
Air Interdiction Detachment (RAID), conducted a regular program to eradicate
domestically-grown marijuana. 	In 2008, the State Police and local law
enforcement agencies found 13,727 plants in 298 outdoor plots. There were also
5,512 marijuana plants eradicated in 105 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication
operations resulted in 335 arrests. 	Seizures included 222 weapons, vehicles,
and other personal property valued at $1,013,009. 	Considering the estimated
yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not
reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $57 million.

Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT 	
mission is to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member
agencies. 	The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 	
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both
	indoor and outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful 	
	prosecution of the growers as a primary goal; 	
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts
	to monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, 	
	and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 	
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns
	in communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement 	
	authorities, and; 	
5. Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the 	
	maximum extent possible. 	
GIANT performed 394 operations during 2008 that resulted in 306 arrests, and 	
the seizure of $29,235,000 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 140 weapons,
21 vehicles, and $63,488 in U.S. currency. 	
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals
to illicit purposes continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug 	
diversion predates the massive abuse of other drugs we know so well today. 	
The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents work with the DEA, the Department
of Health Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus
local law enforcement agencies to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs 	
for illicit purposes. 	
During 2008, Drug Diversion received 2,026 complaints of diversion activities 	
throughout the Commonwealth. 	In response to these complaints, 1,140
investigations were initiated. 	A total of 788 persons were arrested on 1,110
charges. 	Additionally, 12 search warrants were executed during the past year. 	
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement 	
officials about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions 	
and what they can do about it. 	This role also included educating health care
professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the 	
problem and the importance of self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their 	
individual health care delivery systems. 	During 2008, 12 presentations were
		33
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 34 of 52”
Table: 34
conducted for 373 healthcare professionals, and six presentations were 	
conducted for 212 individuals in law enforcement. 	The Drug Diversion Unit, with
assistance from the Department of Health Professions and the National 	
Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (N.A.D.D.I.), hosted the Eighth 	
Annual Drug Diversion School in Norfolk, Virginia. 		
Criminal Intelligence Division 		
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, 	
document, and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in
organized crime or terrorism. 	CID is currently composed of five units; the 	
Analytical Unit, the Research Unit, the Field Intelligence Unit, the Technical 	
Support Unit, the Computer Evidence Recovery Unit and the Virginia Fusion 	
Center. 		
The Research Unit accomplishes a wide variety of tasks. 	They assist the other
CID units with specific research tasks, field investigations including surveillance,
officer safety issues, the handling of fictitious identifications for undercover 	
personnel and serves as the Department’s primary INTERPOL liaison. 	
INTERPOL has now established a secure VPN connection with the Department.
This connection has simplified and expedited the communication process with
INTERPOL. 		
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide
to collect and supply intelligence, including information on current investigations.
The unit also uses the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The
unit is active in each of the Department’s seven field divisions. 	The Field 	
Intelligence Unit also has five agents assigned to the various FBI Joint Terrorism
Task Forces. 		
In 2008, the Department was instrumental in securing the participation of the
Department of Corrections (DOC) in the Washington-Baltimore HIDTA GangNet
Intelligence System initiative. 	This multi-state regional system continues to be
populated with gang related information by law enforcement agencies in 	
Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia. 	Additional states on the east coats are
expected to join GangNet in the near future. 	The Department has also provided
training to a number of our employees for data entry and user certification into
the GangNet system. 		
In 2008, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) received 1683 requests for service.
Of those requests, 402 were in support of federal, state and local law 	
enforcement agencies. 	Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal
investigations, which were supported by the installation of audio and video 	
recording equipment, Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking equipment, 	
covert surveillance and monitoring equipment, pen registers and other technical
support. 	The unit continues to support significant investigations and uses 	
		34
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 35 of 52”
Table: 35
methods and technologies to assist any requesting law enforcement agency. 	
The unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement
agencies, as well as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ 	
offices through installation and operation of 71 closed circuit television systems
for victims of child abuse. 	The Hostage/Barricade Unit program continues to 	
support state and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated
technical equipment. The Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to 16 		
Hostage/Barricade incident requests. 		
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) provides assistance to local, 	
state and federal law enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search
warrants for computer-related evidence, evidence recovery through forensic 	
examination, and training classes in computer search and seizure. 	In 2008, the
CERU completed 109 investigations on 438 computers and other pieces of digital
evidence involving 24,973 gigabytes of data. 	The CERU also handled over 	
1,500 internet fraud complaints and provided 382 hours of instruction on 	
computer crime. 		
The Research Unit has revised the TIPS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
to provide for a greater accounting of the current users of the system. 	This 	
revision establishes a requirement of user agencies to notify the Department 	
when an individual user leaves their department or no longer has a need to use
the system. 	The section continues to work with the 350 user agencies 	
throughout the Commonwealth by providing training and guidance in the use of
the TIPS system. 	The Research Unit also continues to work with public safety 	
agencies statewide to provide them with the Homeland Security Information 	
System-Virginia (HSIN-VA), a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that will allow 	
intelligence to be posted on a three-tiered system ranging from law enforcement,
emergency management personnel, critical infrastructure companies in both the
private and public sector and the general public. 	CID is currently working with 	
the Information Technology Division to develop a new Virginia Intelligence 	
Management System (VIMS) that will eventually replace TIPS. 		
The Virginia Fusion Center gathers, analyzes and disseminates information and
intelligence as it relates to all criminal activity to include terrorism. 	In 2005, the
Fusion Center moved into a new location within the Virginia Combined 	
Headquarters. 	This joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the 	
Virginia Department of Emergency Management is the first of its kind in the 	
Commonwealth. Its primary mission is to “fuse” together resources from local, 	
state and federal agencies and private industries to facilitate information 	
collection, analysis and sharing, in order to prevent or deter criminal activity. 	Its
secondary mission is to support the Virginia Emergency Operations Center by 	
centralizing information and resources to provide a coordinated and effective 	
response in the event of an attack or natural disaster.

The VFC operates the Terrorism Hotline and the Drug Hotline which are 	
initiatives that provide a conduit for the public to provide information on both 	
terrorist and criminal activities. 	Since April 2005, the Terrorism Hotline has 	
received 346 actionable reports. 	The Drug Hotline has received 488 actionable
calls since September 2007. 	The Homeland Security Information Network, 	
Virginia Portal (HSIN-VA) allows for public and private entities that have a need
and right to access certain databases a method of retrieving common operating
picture information. 	The VFC’s Critical infrastructure/Key Resource (CI/KR) 	
program is not only cataloging important infrastructure throughout the 	
Commonwealth, but is providing training to state and local first responders on 	
crime prevention and target hardening for sites in their jurisdictions. 	The Fusion
Liaison Officer (FLO) program is training first responders in what suspicious 	
activities could be precursors to criminal or terrorist activity and how to report the
information to the VFC. 		
Support Services Division (SSD) 		
The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004 as a result of the
Department’s reorganization of BCI. The Insurance Fraud Division, Help 	
Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) and the Drug Diversion Unit were decentralized
and absorbed within SSD. 	Agents assigned to these units have continued their
current investigative assignments while operating out of the seven BCI field 	
offices. 		
SSD is responsible for law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns 	
and insurance industry outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program
(IFP) and Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) units. 	The Arson/Bomb Program,
the Drug Diversion Program and the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction 	
Unit (CCI) are also under the SSD umbrella. 	SSD provides statistical gathering,
technical training and financial management support for these various units. 	The
H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free telephone hotlines are administered and
maintained by the SSD. 	Initial notifications of suspected insurance fraud and 	
auto theft activities are received via the SSD hotlines, Web sites, e-mails and 	
faxes. 	The notifications are reviewed and distributed to the appropriate local law
enforcement agencies or to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s field offices for
investigation. 		
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 		
Since its establishment on July 1, 2000 by the Virginia General Assembly, the 	
Special Operations Division (SOD) has undergone a remarkable transformation.
SOD’s original mission was the interdiction of narcotics on Virginia’s highways, 	
public transportation systems, schools and businesses. 	SOD also provided 	
assistance to local police departments to address localized drug and firearm

Following the events of September 11, 2001, the Special Operations Divisions 	
was re-designated as the Special Operations Unit, and expanded its personnel,
offices and duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit carried out
the Virginia State Police Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) Homeland Security 	
responsibilities related to response and recovery operations. 	The unit serves to
coordinate the response of other resources and serves as core members of the
Statewide Regional Response Teams. 			
On January 10, 2003, the name of the unit was changed to the Counter- 	
Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) with fully operational teams in each
of the seven traditional State Police Divisions. 	On August 10, 2003, command of
the unit was transferred to the Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI), Support
Services Division. 					
In November 2005, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new strategic
initiative developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes.

Homeland Security - The CCI Homeland Security component is prepared to 	
respond to a terror-related event to recover hazardous material evidence and 	
assist other federal, state, and local agencies. 	Many team members are certified
Hazardous Material Technicians trained to enter a scene that may be 	
contaminated with biological, chemical, or radiological substances. 	Each team is
equipped with detection and monitoring equipment to identify and classify 	
hazardous substances employed during a terror attack and collect samples for
the purposes of determining treatment for persons exposed and obtaining 	
evidence for prosecution. 	Some of the team members have completed 	
Environmental Crimes Investigation training provided by the Virginia Department
of Fire Programs. 					
Additional training is ongoing to further prepare the teams to deal with terrorist-
related bombings, suicide bombers, radiological attacks, and chemical nerve 	
agent attacks. 	All team members are being trained to operate within the National
Incident Management Systems (NIMS) Incident Command System. 	The teams
attend stakeholder meetings and training with the local Hazardous Materials 	
Teams and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) 	
Regional Hazardous Material Officers and the National Guard’s 34th Civil Support

Team. 	The teams also conduct training quarterly to maintain certification utilizing
assigned Personal Protective Equipment and Self Contained Breathing 	
Apparatus. 	
The unit has specialized response vehicles that are equipped with forensic 	
equipment specifically designed for evidence collection in hazardous 	
environments, radiological detection equipment, Multi-Rae Combustible Gas 	
Indicator equipped with a photo ionization detectors to identify volatile and toxic
gases, chemical and biological weapons detecting equipment, satellite television
capabilities, weather monitoring equipment, emergency decontamination stations
and rehabilitation tents. 	The unit also has Hazardous Material Identification
Instruments that will allow field analysis of liquids and powders. 	
In August 2008, the unit accepted delivery of the ASP-L (Advanced 	
Spectroscopic Portal) radiation detection vehicle. 	This vehicle contains state of
the art radiation detecting sensors coupled with advanced computer equipment
which have the capability of detecting and classifying sources of radiation which
are being transported along the highways of the Commonwealth. 	This vehicle
has been used during a multi-state preparedness exercise and was deployed for
the 2009 Presidential Inauguration. 	
	BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of
over 64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia.
Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal
law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the ability of local law 	
enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor
Vehicle Safety Inspection Program regarding the enforcement of motor carrier 	
and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides 	
aerial support for law enforcement activities and emergency medical 	
evacuations. 	
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize 	
uniformed police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further 	
subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or 	
counties. Staffing is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and 	
county level.

Enforcement Initiatives to Address Highway Safety 			
Checkpoint Strikeforce 									
Identifying and removing drunk drivers from the highways of the 			
Commonwealth of Virginia is a primary objective of State Police 			
Troopers in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our 			
nation. Checkpoint Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement 			
campaign that involves saturation patrols and DUI sobriety 				
checkpoints every week on specific highways and in locations 			
where alcohol related incidents and arrests have been identified. 			
This national campaign is supported by the National Highway 			
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and involves significant 			
public education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 			
During 2008, a total of 17,800 vehicles passed through 34 DUI sobriety 		
checkpoints resulting in 90 drunk driving arrests. Additionally, DUI saturation 	
patrols were conducted on Interstates, primary and secondary highways 		
throughout Virginia resulting in arrest and the removal 360 alcohol impaired 	
drivers. 											
Operation Air, Land, and Speed 								
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and
implemented an enforcement plan in July, 2006, to effectively reduce and 	
eliminate vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort
was also intended to combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving
behavior on Interstates that pass through Virginia to make travel in our 		
Commonwealth safe and enjoyable for motorists. 					
With the success of this program, seven enforcement phases were conducted in
2008:

During the 7 enforcement phases conducted throughout the year 2008, there 	
was one fatal crash on the involved interstate highways where enforcement was
increased and visibility heightened. Virginia has experienced only two fatal 	
crashes since the program’s inception. 			
Trooper Bowl 					
Trooper Bowl is a high visibility DUI enforcement initiative that has spread 	
throughout the Commonwealth. It kicked off following a successful initial program
conducted on Interstate 66 following the NFL Super Bowl - XL. The primary 	
objective of Trooper Bowl is to identify and arrest motorists driving under the 	
influence of alcohol and jeopardizing highway safety. The 2008, initiative resulted
in 265 traffic arrests including 8 arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Click-it-or-Ticket 				
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the 	
primary functions of this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen a 	
steady average increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in
1997, to 80.6 % recorded in 2008. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness,
education, and enforcement to gain compliance with existing safety belt laws. 	
Increasing the use of safety belts and child safety seats have statistically shown
to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting from traffic crashes. 	
During the May phase of Click-it-or-Ticket 	state police personnel issued 1,730 	
summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 443 summonses for child safety
restraint violations. 				
Smooth Operator 				
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative intended, which aims 	
to provide education, information and solutions for the problem of aggressive 	
driving. For nearly 10 years, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have 	
partnered through the Smooth Operator Program to combat aggressive driving. 	
Law enforcement agencies, trauma experts, government officials and other 	
professionals have worked together to educate motorists of the risks involved 	
with aggressive driving, and to stigmatize aggressive driving behavior on our 	
roads.

Operation Cruise Control
Effective July 1, 2005, the State Police implemented “Operation Cruise Control”
to increase visibility and enforcement efforts to address all types of violations and
the reckless operations of a vehicle on Interstate 81 from our border with
Tennessee to the West Virginia state line.
During 2008, the operation was proven successful in controlling driver behavior
and preventing crashes and their destruction. Throughout 2008, troopers devoted
2,038 additional work hours to Interstate 81 and patrolled 34,782 miles resulting
in approximately 3,381 traffic summonses and 39 criminal arrests. From the
traffic arrests made, 1,931 were for speed violations and 344 arrests were made
for reckless driving.
Operation C.A.R.E.
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major
holidays of Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are
the primary purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.).
During these major holiday periods that are noted for increased highway travel,
the Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address
highway safety and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth.
Highway Safety Corridors
There are currently 3 highway safety corridors in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Two are on Interstate 95, one in Prince William County and the second in
Henrico Country. The other highway safety corridor is on Interstate 81 in
Roanoke County. Highway safety corridors were established as an additional
measure to gain driver compliance to posted speed limits and other applicable
traffic laws. The corridor locations were determined based on statistical crash
data that identified specific sections of a highway to have a higher than normal
crash rate when compared to other segments of the same highway. Establishing
the Highway Safety Corridor allows the courts to impose higher penalties for
violations cited by police for traffic violations and criminal offenses.
A comprehensive review of highway traffic data for 2008, indicates that within the
highway safety corridors traffic crashes are lower than in the previous years, and
average vehicle speeds and driver behavior was improved.
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis
During 2008, each of the department’s seven field divisions continued
enforcement emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within
the counties in their divisions. Each division’s program focused resources on
those highways where crashes, traffic violations, and citizen complaints
regarding traffic were noted. The objectives of this initiative were to prevent
crashes, reduce violations, and address the concerns citizens identified as
threats to their safety.

Safety Division
As of December 31, 2008, there were 4,383 active inspection stations located
throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 14,696 licensed safety
inspectors who performed approximately 7,728,200 inspections at appointed
stations during 2008. Approximately 18% (1,365,150 vehicles) of all vehicles
submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components.
This Division investigated 2,554 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,290
instances of disciplinary action against 185 stations for various classes of
offenses and the suspension of 35 inspection stations. These statistics include
administrative errors made by inspection stations, and the majority of errors/
complaints were corrected by counseling sessions.
Disciplinary action was also taken against 675 safety inspectors, resulting in 138
suspensions.
Safety Division personnel also conducted 1,162 business security checks.
Motor Carrier Safety
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet
safety requirements on Virginia highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor
Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other
interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations.
They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training seminars.
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 38 hazardous material spills or
incidents in 2008 and conducted 136 post-crash investigations of heavy
commercial vehicles involved in accidents.
Data indicates that during 2008, Troopers conducted 40,827 in-depth inspections
on heavy commercial vehicles and 9,372 of these, or 23 percent, were placed out
of service for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and
transportation of hazardous materials.
Field Support
The Safety Division’s sworn employees provided support for local field divisions
during all major C.A.R.E. holidays. During 2008, Safety Division troopers had
8,498 arrests/summonses issued, investigated 140 motor vehicle crashes,
assisted local Troopers with the investigation of 93 motor vehicle crashes, and
assisted 2,622 disabled motorists.

The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any Federal, State, or municipal 	
agency whereby the solution of a police problem or mission may be obtained. 	
During 2008, the Unit provided aerial support to 56 requests from agencies 	
external to the Department of State Police. These flights included photographing
crime scenes, providing support for presidential motorcades, participating in 	
multi-agency task force efforts, and demonstrations of the capabilities of the 	
Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008, the 	
Aviation Unit flew 2,821 hours responding to 3,118 flight requests. 	
Motorist Assistance Program 	
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the department currently operates
in the four largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake,
Fairfax, Richmond, and in the Roanoke/Salem areas. 	
During 2008, motorist assistance aides provided assistance to disabled or 	
stranded motorist on more than 46,658 occasions. 	
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires,
providing gasoline, jump-starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular 	
phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family members of a stranded 	
motorist's situation. Motorist Assistance Aides also were instrumental in the

arrest of drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting erratic driving
behavior to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension.
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose
primary responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial
vehicles that utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. During 2008,
approximately 18.8 million commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13
permanent weigh stations for inspection. Through the inspection of these
vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial Vehicle
Enforcement Officers issued 51,240 summonses and made 112 criminal arrests.
This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway safety program through the
protection of roadways from overweight and oversized vehicles; through
assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the
highways; and through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to
ensure they are properly licensed to operate a commercial vehicles in the
Commonwealth.
Crime Prevention
During 2008, the Department continued to provide specialized training to the
Crime Prevention Specialist troopers across the State on current crime
prevention techniques. Participating troopers received training in enhancing
governmental, business, and residential security through the "Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model and other mitigation based
methodologies. Additional training focused on personal safety, workplace
violence prevention and personal information associated crimes. All training was
part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to
achieve certification or remain certified through the Department of Criminal
Justice Services as Crime Prevention Specialist.
In calendar year 2008, approximately 176,000 citizens of Virginia were contacted
through 2,715 various crime prevention and safety programs. These programs
distributed nearly 30,000 informational handouts by certified crime prevention
troopers. Troopers conducted 394 crime prevention programs and 784 Safety
Programs. In addition 114 programs were conducted to address personal safety,
36 programs addressed the issues of road rage, 10 workplace violence
workshops were held, and 7 programs were sponsored on recognizing and
preventing schemes and scams.
Crime prevention troopers also conducted security assessments on 948
businesses and residences. Additionally, during 2008, troopers conducted 45
drug education programs, 7 class action programs, and 9 Help eliminate Auto
Theft (H.E.A.T.) programs to enhance safety in Virginia communities.
Below is a summary of significant crime prevention programs / activities for 2008:
48
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 49 of 52”
Table: 49
• 	The Office of Commonwealth Preparedness (OCP) requested that the
	Department assist the Virginia Capitol Police with providing all-hazard
	assessments or 11 state office buildings located in the new codified
	Capitol District. These assessments were completed over an 11 month
	period and a comprehensive report was submitted to the OCP for
	introduction before the Capitol Security Working Group.
• 	To better assist state agencies with improving security, the Office of
	Commonwealth Preparedness conducted its annual Agency
	Preparedness Assessment. This year the Department was requested to
	submit physical security related recommendations to be included in the
	assessment, of which all recommended questions and topics were
	accepted. The Department will be providing personnel for periodic agency
	on-site reviews in the coming year.
• 	The Virginia Judicial Security Initiative, which was initiated in 2005, has
	continued to require assets from the crime prevention program. These
	assets involved the participation in courthouse assessments, training and
	technical/subject mater expertise. The department’s crime prevention
	specialists, of which 29 are trained for this specialized form of
	assessment, have been directly involved in the assessment of 66
	courthouses across Virginia. The program and its product have been
	recognized by several jurisdictions outside of Virginia and have adopted
	the program as their model.
• 	The Virginia Department of Aviation, in conjunction with the Department
	began addressing the security issues facing Virginia’s 58 General Aviation
	airports. In response, 28 crime prevention troopers received specific
	training needed to conduct comprehensive security assessments on these
	airports. In 2008, the program provided independent assessments for 19
	General Aviation airports across the state. These assessments are not
	only providing recommendations to the individual airports on methods to
	enhance security, but are gathering information which the Department of
	Aviation utilizes in projecting future security needs.
• 	The Department has continued to disseminate gun locks to the public and
	governmental agencies. During 2008, approximately 18,000 locks were
	distributed through public speaking events, county fairs, local public safety
	agencies, and the state fair of Virginia.
• 	The Crime Prevention Program began certification of 5 new troopers to the
	program to account for promotions at the area office level. They should
	receive their certifications in late 2009.
