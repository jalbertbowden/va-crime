	2005 Facts and Figures 	
	THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT 	
	OF STATE POLICE 	
	SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 	
Colonel W. Steven Flaherty was appointed as Superintendent of the Virginia State Police by Governor Mark R.
Warner in October 2003. Lieutenant Colonel Robert B. Northern assumed the position of Deputy
Superintendent in July 2005. 		
The Department is divided primarily into three Bureaus: Administrative and Support Services, Criminal
Investigation, and Field Operations. 	Each Bureau Director, who holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, reports
directly to the Deputy Superintendent. 		
The Superintendent’s Office includes the Executive Protective Unit, Professional Standards Unit, and the
Public Relations Office. 		
Professional Standards Unit 		
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs, internal audit, and staff inspection
functions within the Department of State Police. 		
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations of misconduct on the
part of Department employees. 	During 2005, 914 internal investigations were processed. 	
The Internal Audit Section provides the Department with independent and objective audits and reviews of
Department operations. 	During 2005, the section provided 10 comprehensive audits of operating sections
within the Department. 	The reports included recommendations for strengthening internal controls.
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components within the Department,
ensuring compliance with National Accreditation Standards, OSHA requirements, and Department policies and
procedures. 	Six staff inspections were conducted in 2005. 	The Staff Inspection Section also manages all
records retention and destruction within the Department. 	
Public Relations Office 		
The Public Relations Office (PRO) maintains daily contact with the public and media, disseminates news
releases about Department programs and activities, develops and implements public awareness media
campaigns, conducts media interviews, and responds to various public inquiries. Personnel in this office often
respond to the scenes of major highway and criminal incidents to assist the media in providing information to
the public. 		
The staff includes the Public Relations Manager and two Public Relations Coordinators at Administrative
Headquarters. The Public Relations Office assists and supports the Department’s seven Public Information
Officers deployed in field division headquarters in Richmond, Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake,
Salem, and Fairfax. 		
Public and media relations, information and education are important elements of the PRO. 	In 2005, PRO staff
re-instituted a quarterly inter-departmental newsletter. 	The multi-page publication is distributed to all active
and retired State Police members, and is available in both paper and electronic formats. 	Thirty-six news
releases were sent to media outlets statewide in 2005. 	Many of these dealt with transportation-related safety
messages or initiatives. 	Altogether, Public Information Officers statewide distributed a total of 113 press
releases informing the media of fatal and /or major traffic crashes, safety campaigns, and enforcement
initiatives within their respective cities and counties.

Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 2 of 35”
Table: 2
In 2005, press releases, campaigns, news conferences, and incidents generated roughly 9,666 articles in
newspapers throughout the Commonwealth.
In addition, the PRO is responsible for the following responsibilities:
• 	Serving as the primary contact for the media and citizens;
• 	Overseeing the Department’s annual exhibit for the State Fair of Virginia;
• 	Preparing speeches and public presentations for key department personnel;
• 	Designing and developing brochures, forms and certificates;
• 	Handling shoulder patch requests;
• 	Conducting media training;
• 	Developing and maintaining the Department’s Internet presence, and responding to and/or routing e-mail
	messages received over the web.
	BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATIVE
	AND SUPPORT SERVICES
The Bureau of Administrative and Support Services includes the divisions of Communications,
Criminal Justice Information Services, Information Technology and Planning, Personnel,
Property and Finance, Statewide Agencies Radio System, Sworn Programs and Training.
Employees in these areas provide the Department, especially troopers and special agents in
the field, with essential services through their extensive technical and professional expertise.
These services range from: 	
• 	Purchasing and configuring personal computers ... to designing complex and sophisticated
	computerized systems to maintain critical criminal files;
• 	Installing police radios and radar units in patrol vehicles ... to designing and implementing a
	Computer-Aided Dispatch System;
• 	Employing a qualified and diversified work force ... to managing an exciting volunteer
	program;
• 	Managing and maintaining Department buildings and grounds across the State ... to
	preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the Department’s annual budget;
• 	Providing criminal justice agencies with rapid access to local, state and national criminal
	justice files ... to supervising Virginia’s Firearms Transaction Program;
• 	Conducting research into innovative law enforcement techniques and products ... to
	coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grant management programs.
The Bureau also develops and proposes legislation involving traffic safety and criminal
statutes, and serves as liaison during General Assembly sessions for discussion of issues.
Communications Division 	
The Communications Division is responsible for the proper installation, operation, and
maintenance of telephone, land mobile radio, and microwave radios assigned to the
Communications Division. 	
	2
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 3 of 35”
Table: 3
Under the command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates
and maintains land mobile radios, microwave radios and private telephone networks. 	The
system includes 87 microwave radio sites, 46 of which also have land mobile radio base
stations. 	This responsibility includes compliance with requirements of the Federal 	
Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 		
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible for:
• 	Maintaining mobile radios; 			
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios; 		
• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals; 		
• 	Provision of pager, cellular, and wireless data equipment and services; 		
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, obstruction lighting, antennas and
	emergency power plants; 			
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices; 	
• 	Installing and maintaining equipment, telephones, and other telecommunications at
	Administrative Headquarters; and 		
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for mobile and fixed 	
	communications equipment. 			
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. 	Of the 23 sites 	
considered to be the backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to digital
service. 	Digital microwave equipment has been procured to provide service to the last two
headquarters locations, and to the Eastern Shore. 	These six sites are nearly complete and
will be in operation to Division IV, VII, and the Eastern Shore by late summer. 	Site leases
have been executed and microwave site development is progressing to provide that 	
service. 	Cooperative development or collocation agreements continue to fund equipment
upgrades from analog to digital microwave systems. 	These collocation and relocation
agreements have saved the Department approximately $8.5 million over the past seven
years. 				
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 	
Program team to define the existing network and review plans for the new upgraded State
Police Land Mobile Radio Network that will serve all of the Commonwealth’s state-level
public safety agencies. 			
The Division has procured and installed almost 400 mobile computer terminals (MCT) and
wireless modems to be used for messaging and routine checks of drivers’ licenses and
vehicle registrations. Currently, new generation mobile services are being investigated to
provide higher capacity and better coverage to a larger geographic area. 	Additionally,
some troopers in the Roanoke area have been equipped with MCTs through a partnership
with the City of Roanoke. 			
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with
new copper and fiber optic service. 	Telephone system upgrades continue as needed at
area offices and division headquarters statewide. 		
In addition to mission-critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates
and supports wireless communications equipment and services from public networks.
		3 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 4 of 35”
Table: 4
These services make Department personnel more accessible and keep them better
informed regarding routine and administrative activities. 	The number of wireless
telephones approved and in use has doubled in the past year, and now approaches 1,000
units. 		
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for
special events as they occur. 	Such activities include communications to support security
for visiting dignitaries, as well as routine events where large groups of spectators gather
over short periods of time. 		
All field Division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by The Division of
Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning forks. 	In the past
year, approximately 100 additional RADAR units were procured and issued to expand
availability and replace older units. 	The present inventory of active radars is approximately
1,500 units. The majority of Department radars are newer Eagle units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone and local area network wiring requirements for
the Department, as well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000
items of equipment are being maintained for six additional agencies. The Division also
continues to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most of the state’s
public safety agencies. 	The Communications Division has actively participated with the
Capital Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN)
activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area.
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all
related files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation, monitoring,
destruction, and archiving of records in accordance with the State Police Records
Retention Schedule. 	The Division processed and responded to 2,262 subpoenas and 13
Freedom of Information Act requests in 2005. 	
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 	
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 22,575 investigative
reports in 2005. 	CCRE automated 1,564 non-computerized criminal records in calendar
year 2005 leaving a total of 153,911 misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated.
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 	
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts, and 124 Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	In 2005, 407,511
records were transmitted, negating the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy
disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions transmitted, there were 71,153 or 17.5%
rejected. 	In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented.
Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated for
missing arrest fingerprint cards. 	For 2005, notifications for 24,952 individual charges were
generated. 	The majority of notifications (96%) were generated because the court did/could
not include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data. 	The remaining
notifications (4%) were generated when the court transmitted the Document Control
Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file.

Table: 5
Non-Criminal Justice Program 		
In 2005, the Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 79,197 fingerprint based
searches and 264,385 name search requests. 	On February 8, 1996, the Non Criminal
Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant growth and demand for
criminal history record requests. 	The NCJI can be accessed through the Department’s
website. 	This interface eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process a
high volume of “paper record name-search” requests. 	In 2005, since implementation
CCRE staff processed 109,766 or 42% paper inquiries and 154,619 or 58% electronic
name transmissions received from participants with an average response time of 72 hours
or less. 	This method of automation has tremendously enhanced customer service.
Mental Health File 		
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to
purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these categories are received
from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual being incompetent,
involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. 	As of December 31, 2005, there were
7,938 mental health records added, bringing the total records on file to 70,787.
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 	
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 12,293 fingerprint-based registrations received
since July 1, 1997. 	The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in
particular, by providing personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals
convicted of certain sex crimes. 	Photographs of offenders are available, and violent
offender registrations are maintained on the Internet. 	There were 165,081 searches
conducted against the Registry for employment-licensure purposes in 2005. 	During 2005,
the SOR verified the address of 22,680 sex offenders and initiated 2,616 criminal
investigations to the field divisions. 		
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 	
As of December 31, 2005, there were 182,846 offenders on file with commitments received
from the Virginia Department of Corrections, which accounts for 12.5% of the offenders on
file. 	The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information Interface improved the
criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional information with minimal
error. 		
The Microfilm Section 		
This section archived 1,029,128 documents during 2005. 	
Photographic Laboratory 		
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for photographs,
digital images, and court enlargements. 	Additionally, there were 147,513 photographic
prints, a decrease of 0.4%, developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and
prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases in 2005. 	The lab also processed
72 compact discs (CD’s) due to digital camera use. 	
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 	
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and partial latent
fingerprints recovered from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are
located at State Police Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state
and local agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their respective
	5

Table: 6
agencies. 	The newly acquired Global Transaction Controller receives Live Scan 	
transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS systems
for searching and updates. 	The installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive System
has enhanced our ability in the storage and retrieval of fingerprint records. 	Currently, there
were 440,000 Virginia SID folders created in the Electronic Archive System. 		
Currently, there are 1,657,820 ten-print fingerprint records on file and 82,635 unsolved
latent fingerprints in the database; also, the Slap database has 173,711 images. 	In 2005,
there were 2,825 suspects identified as a result of successful latent print searches on the
AFIS system. 	We no longer track latent hits. 		
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest and
fingerprint information to the State Police and the FBI, which has enhanced the agencies
ability to detect aliases and outstanding warrants on arrestees prior to their release.
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 			
Currently, there are 122 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 150 Live Scan units. 	In addition,
there are 62 civilian applicant Live Scan sites utilizing 80 Live Scan Units. 	A total of 34
criminal Live Scan sites are submitting criminal justice and concealed weapon applicant
information via Live Scan. 	The following is a brief comparison of statistics. 	The 	
percentages reflect the increase or decrease in 2005. 		
CATEGORY 	% of CHANGE 		
1. Arrest records processed 	+1.74% 		
2. Arrest records via Live Scan 	+0.3%

During 2005, the fingerprint section processed 250,454 criminal arrests and 144,412
applicants. 			
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 		
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques,
based on the results of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2005,
215,062 firearm transactions were conducted, which is a 4% increase in transactions
conducted during 2005. 	Of these, 2,668 (13% increase) were denied based on the result of
a criminal history record information check. During 2005, 216 wanted persons were
identified, which resulted in the arrest of 81 individuals in Virginia, and the arrest of 15
nonresidents who were attempting to purchase rifles or shotguns in Virginia while named in
an outstanding warrant from another state. 	In 2005, the State Police requested 943
criminal investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to purchase firearms, of which
734 (78%) resulted in arrests. 			
	6 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 7 of 35”
Table: 7
Direct Access 		
Approximately 28% of the statewide volume of VFTP criminal history record information
checks were processed via on-site terminals at the physical location of the participating
Direct Access Program firearms dealers. 	The State Police Firearms Transaction Center
continues to enhance and expand direct access to the VFTP. 	As on-line users increase,
staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and verification processes.
Additional employee time devoted to these other processes provide more efficient overall
services to the firearm dealers and purchasers. 		
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun
dealer to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification number for
qualified employees. 	As of December 31, 2005, the State Police has issued 6,661 seller
identification numbers. 		
Concealed Handgun Permits 		
Since July 1, 1995, 284,314 concealed handgun permits were issued as authorized by
Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 22,274 were issued in 2005 (18% reduction) by Virginia
Circuit Courts. 	During 2005, 475 nonresident concealed handgun permits were issued by
the State Police. 		
Pursuant to statute, the State Police enters the permit holder’s name and description in the
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) so that the permit's existence and current
status will be made known to law-enforcement personnel accessing the Network for
investigative purposes. 		
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 		
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident
Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the
state on 46 different crime offenses. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hardcopy
reports. 	Data is submitted either by diskette or via the Internet. 	The diskettes are scanned,
copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	The Internet files are submitted through the IBR
website. 	This is a secure system to which only contributing agencies have access. 	Twice
a week, the submitted files are run through the edit process, which generates an error
report in order for the agencies to correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR
central repository database. 	A monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated and emailed to
the FBI for inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United States. 	
During 2005, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues, 	
interpretation of error reports, and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting 	
procedures, as well as assisted vendors with reporting issues. 	There are 18 private
vendors representing IBR certified agencies. 	Several large agencies have built their own
in-house software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly reports are now posted on the IBR
website rather than having to be mailed to each contributing agency. 	The UCR office
responded to approximately ten requests daily for crime statistics from state agencies,
government officials, students, media, and the general public. 	
Statistical crime data was published in the CJIS Newsletter, the annual report, Crime in
Virginia, and distributed to contributing agencies. 	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges,
legislators, and other state agencies also received the information. 	The annual report is
available to the public for a nominal fee. 	In 2005, the annual report was published for the
first time on a CD rather than hard copy. 		
	7 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 35”
Table: 8
The Crime in Virginia report can also be found on the State Police website. 	This report
contains reported Group A offenses by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A
and Group B arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	The data is used for law 		
enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and legislative implementation. 		
The IBR website went into production in 2002. 	At the beginning of 2005, there were 240
agencies that submitted their monthly data through the Internet. 	By the end of the year,
there were 249 agencies that switched from mailing diskettes to electronically sending files
via the Internet. 	This site provides law enforcement agencies with the convenience of on-
line monthly data submission, receiving timely error notifications, and monthly and year-to-
date statistical reports, performing searches and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals, 		
bulletins, and posting inquiries in the FAQ section. 			
During 2005, there were three law enforcement officers in Virginia who were feloniously
killed while performing their duties. 	The 2005 offenses and arrest data will not be available
until approximately the middle of March. 	Through IBR Grant funding, the front end of the
IBR website is being changed to allow agencies to submit monthly files for editing so they
may correct rejected incidents before sending data to Virginia’s IBR central repository. 	This
first phase of the IBR Grant is to be completed by June 30, 2006. The Department will seek
additional funding to complete Phase 2 and 3 of the improvement project. 			
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) 				
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 708 member agencies with 7,952 terminals, an 		
increase of 1,449 terminals, or 18% over the number of terminals in 2005. 	Of these 		
terminals, there were 2,898 non-mobile terminals (an 8% increase over 2004), and 5,054
terminals are mobile, (an increase of 32% from 2005 and 36% increase from 2003). 	In 	
2005, VCIN processed approximately 280,626,021 transactions (an increase of 3% of the
2005 totals) between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state computer databases. 	This
system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three seconds. 		
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which
is critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information
relating to wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently
retains Virginia information relating to 50,130 wanted persons (a 10% percent increase as
compared to 2005), 944 missing persons, and 12,398 stolen vehicles. 			
Information Technology and Planning Division 			
Information Technology 				
The Information Technology Section operates one of the largest computer centers in state
government. 	Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment
and software provided by vendors such as IBM, NEC Corporation, UNISYS Corporation
and SUN Micro Systems. 	The section operates two separate computer rooms 24 hours a
day. 				
Automated Fingerprint Processing 				
In 2005, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 230 systems in 184 local law 		
enforcement and civil applicant agencies. 	More than 210,000 arrest fingerprints were 		
electronically transmitted to State Police in 2005 from local law enforcement agencies. 	
This represents 84% of the arrest volume in Virginia. 	Approximately 80% of the arrests
received electronically at State Police were processed without human intervention. 		
	8 			
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 35”
Table: 9
In response to legislation requiring photographs to be submitted with arrest records 	
beginning January 1, 2006, a handful of local law enforcement agencies began submitting
records electronically on November 21, 2005, and submitted 1,270 arrests with one or
more photographs in the short time period before the end of the year. 		
In 2005, over 144,000 applicant prints were processed through the automated applicant
system, which reduces the turnaround time from months to days. 	Fifty-three percent of
these applicant requests were initiated at Live Scan devices and were processed with
minimal human intervention. 				
Virtual Private Network (VPN) 			
In 2002, the Telecommunications Engineering Section began replacing the Department’s
internal and external dedicated circuit networks with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This
type of network connection uses the Internet for agencies connecting to State Police offices
throughout the State. 	This networking configuration is cost efficient as multiple 	
communications links to an agency can now be combined to one link. 	In 2005, all sites
were converted to the VPN network. 	The VPN network supports the Virginia Criminal 	
Information Network (VCIN), the Live Scan Fingerprint System, the Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS), and the Tactical Intelligence Processing System (TIPS). 	
Network Infrastructure 				
In 2005, in conjunction with the VPN project, bandwidth was increased to division and area
offices within the State Police. 	Also in 2005, the network infrastructure was increased to
support the new Combined State Police Headquarters. 	With this upgrade, State Police can
provide a more stable and higher speed network and be in a better position to expand
services as required in the ever-changing law enforcement environment. 	
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 		
The VCIN system processed over 280 million transactions in 2005, which is an increase of
7 million compared to 2004. 	In addition, Virginia State Police completed the conversion of
agencies from Frame Relay to the Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This will allow Virginia to
support 128 bit encryption to satisfy the FBI security requirements for dissemination of
information. 				
Disaster Recovery Project: State and Local Emergency Preparedness Program 	
(SLEP) 				
A new Sun Microsystems model 6800 system has been installed at SPHQ and another Sun
system was installed at a Disaster Recovery site for fail over. 	All applications on the 	
UNISYS mainframe were converted to the Sun 6800 system in August 2005. The Sun
system completely replaces the mainframe and provides for recovery to the Disaster site in
case the State Police Administrative Headquarters site is not available for an extended
period. 	This project was completed in July 2005. 		
Planning and Research 				
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all divisions
and units of the Department and is responsible for: 		
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies; 	
• 	Updating staffing formulas; 			
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs; 	
		9 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 10 of 35”
Table: 10
• 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies; 	
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s performance measures;
• 	Providing support in the development of grant applications and budgetary submissions;
• 	Conducting legislative studies mandated by the General Assembly;
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan;
• 	Preparing the annual Use of Force Report; 		
• 	Conducting the annual Citizen Survey. 		
During 2005, the Planning and Research Section administered 25 grants that provided
approximately $29 million in funding for agency projects. 	
Accreditation 			
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement
services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally
accepted standards. 	Accreditation requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of the
Department’s organization, operations, and administration. 	
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the
nation to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies
(CALEA), Inc. In 1991, 1996, 2001, and again in 2005, the Department achieved
reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review by CALEA assessors of the
agency’s policies, procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an on-
going project for all accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring
and periodic updating of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally
accepted law enforcement standards. 	In December 2005, the Department was one of
eleven agencies awarded a Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully
maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 	
Personnel Division 			
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management,
with continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the Department’s
work force. 			
Recruitment Unit 			
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in 2003 to include a first sergeant, seven full-time
recruiters, and one part-time secretary. 	Refocusing recruitment efforts has enabled the
Department to concentrate on recruiting and hiring the most qualified diverse workforce to
meet the demand of the future of policing in our global community.
Specific recruitment strategies were designed and implemented to aid in accomplishing the
goals of the unit. 	In 2005, the Recruitment Unit conducted a total of 617 programs at various
venues across the Commonwealth utilizing the following strategies:
Recruitment “Lunch Boxes” – These programs are directed at Virginia’s universities, colleges,
and community colleges during the spring and fall semesters. 	Recruiters set up in student
unions, dining halls, etc., to introduce students to career opportunities within the Department.
These programs also foster positive relationships between the student citizens and law
enforcement officers. 	Recruiters conduct three such programs per month in their respective
divisions.

Table: 11
Civic/Women/Minority Organizations – A variety of organizations have been identified in each
of the Department’s seven field divisions. 	Each recruiter is required to present three of these
programs per month with one of the three programs directed at women’s recruitment. 	
Military Recruitment – Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning military
personnel. 	Virginia has the most military facilities of any state in the nation and the military 	
offers a very diverse candidate pool. 		
Student Athlete Recruitment – A minimum of two programs per month while school is in 	
session at identified college or university athletic unions and organizations. 	Recruiters have
also identified health clubs, and are actively recruiting personnel who attend these facilities. 	
One of the two programs per month must be focused on women’s recruitment. 	
Career Fairs – Career fairs are conducted at various locations throughout the Commonwealth
and in adjoining states. 	Career fairs throughout the state are attended on a selected basis. 	
Career Sessions – Career Sessions have been scheduled quarterly throughout the state. 	
Through demonstrations and static displays of vehicles and equipment, personnel promote the
Department while recruiters furnish employment information. The focus of these events is on
the recruitment of minorities and women. 		
Employment Section 		
The Department hired 78 trooper trainees for the 109th Basic Session that began on February
10, 2005, and 87 trooper trainees for the 110th Basic Session that began on August 25, 2005.
These troopers’ applications were processed from a pool of 1,924 applications received. 	The
applicants for these schools took the Law Enforcement Services, Inc. battery of written tests
and on-line personal history questionnaire. 		
The Employment Section advertised 389 civilian positions throughout the year (232 full-time
and 157 wage) during 2005. 	This is an 18.6% increase in the 328 positions advertised in 	
2004. 	The total number of applicants who applied in 2005 was 4,053. 	This is a 3.4% increase
in the 3,921 applications received during 2004. 	
The Employment Section processed 24 grievances during 2005, an increase of four from 	
2004. 	There were 62 written notices processed, an increase of 29.2% from the 48 written 	
notices processed in 2004. 	Three equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints were filed
in 2005 (1 federal and 2 state), compared to zero filed in 2004. 	
During 2005, 71 volunteers gave 9,748 hours of their time in locations throughout the state. 	In
April, a volunteer recognition event was held to thank our devoted volunteers for their service
to the Department in 2005. 	Speakers at the event were Dr. David Stein, author and Professor
of Psychology at Longwood University, and Ms. Sara Redding-Wilson, Director of Human 	
Resource Management (DHRM). 		
The Virginia State Police contracted with Human Performance Systems Inc. (HPS) to develop
medical guidelines to aid the examining physician in determining the suitability of individuals
for sworn positions. 	These medical guidelines were developed by a task force of medical 	
specialists who evaluated the essential functions of sworn positions relative to specific 	
diseases and conditions of each body system. 	The medical specialists used job analysis and
ergonomic data to identify the degree of impairment for each disease or condition that would
likely preclude an individual from safely and effectively performing the job duties.

Effective September 15, 2005, the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Employment
Commission (VEC) have joined in a partnership to provide clerical/computer testing to potential
applicants. 	This will be a 12-month pilot program to determine the feasibility of conducting
clerical testing for support positions. 		
The Employment Unit provides training to Department supervisors and employees on
Workplace Harassment, Workplace Violence, and Grievance procedures. 	All new employees
receive a comprehensive orientation, which provides a broad overview of the operation of the
Virginia State Police, the procedures and policies that guide the agency, including performance
expectations, compensation, and benefits. 	Education and training to all employees continues
to prove very successful. There were no complaints of workplace harassment or workplace
violence in 2005. 		
Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section (CCTR)
During the 2005 year, the CCTR section processed 267 new employees on payroll, processed
324 promotions, 386 transfers, 94 separations, 74 retirements, and a large number of address
and name changes. 	During this period, the section also received a large number of
employment history and verification requests, records subpoenas, several Freedom of
Information Act inquiries and several legal inquiries. 	A number of requests for purchase of
individual firearms were also processed. 		
The CCTR section also received, audited and processed four Classification requests from the
Superintendent’s Office, one from BASS, 39 from BCI, 23 from BFO, 35 from CJIS, nine from
Property and Finance, eight from Information Technology and Planning, five from Personnel,
eight from Communications and STARS, and six from Training. 	This section also received and
processed one in-band adjustment from BCI, one from BFO, one from CJIS, two from Property
and Finance, and one from Personnel. 		
In addition, this section established 22 wage positions and responded to seven salary surveys.
CCTR also maintained all weight control records on all sworn personnel, central Personnel
Records, all Background Records, all Position files and selected medical files for the
Department. 	Additionally, this section reviewed and processed all VEC inquiries, processed
employees entering and returning from military service, and analyzed and returned
explanations for audit exceptions reports for all pay transactions. 	
This section reviewed and processed 2,554 performance evaluations for 2005, which included
792 rated as extraordinary contributor, 1,004 major contributor, 754 contributors, three
marginal contributors, and one below contributor. 	In this period, six appeals were received,
three ratings were increased and three were sustained. 	Wage employees were also rated in
this same period and their position records were updated for the next cycle.
The section also conducted a study of civilian pay inequities and is continuing to review civilian
salaries for employees in the same roles and having similar years of service in comparison to
those in other state agencies and within the Department. 	Recommendations for adjustment
are pending, depending upon budgetary and other factors. 	
Property and Finance Division 		
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial and property
management functions. 	It is responsible for preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the
Department's annual operating budget, which was in excess of $213,581,000 for fiscal year
	12 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 13 of 35”
Table: 13
2005. 	It was responsible for the procurement, warehousing, and distribution of more than
$20,493,949 in supplies and equipment last year. 	The Property and Finance Division is also
responsible for the management and maintenance of more than 110 buildings and grounds
across the state. 		
During calendar year 2005, construction was completed on the new Combined Virginia State
Police Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center. 	Construction was also completed on
the new Fusion Center, which has been incorporated into the new headquarters addition.
Construction was started and completed on the new Network Operations Center for the
STARS program. 	Plans are underway to acquire an existing office building in Buchanan
County for the new area office. 		
In addition to its property and financial management duties, the Division oversees the 	
mailroom and printing sections, which processed 443,078 pieces of mail during 2005, and
printed of 4,961,679 copies. 	It also manages the garage, which is responsible for equipping
and issuing a fleet of approximately 2,100 vehicles. 	
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military
Property Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost,
military property and equipment that is in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The
Department is appointed by the Governor as the point of contact, and provides a state 	
coordinator. 	The program serves over 250 Virginia law enforcement agencies and in 2005 the
program distributed goods valued over $1.1 million dollars. 	
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day 	
operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122
Program.” 	This program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law
enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic activities through the federal procurement
channels at substantial savings. 	During 2005, over $6,421,162 was purchased through this
program, saving the Department $1,102,125. 		
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 	
The Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program was originally conceived in the mid-
1990s to be an upgrade to the Virginia State Police's antiquated 1977 land mobile radio
system. 	As planning progressed, both technological advances and direction from state
government led the program to the present concept of a shared system composed of the 21
state agencies that use two-way radio communication as a regular part of their operations.
On July 13, 2005, Colonel W. Steven Flaherty, State Police Superintendent, and Mr. Mark
Moon, Vice President and General Manager of Motorola, signed a $329 million contract
between Motorola and the Commonwealth of Virginia for the design, construction, and 	
implementation of STARS. 	A ceremonial contract signing was held on July 16, 2005 in
conjunction with a press conference. 	The implementation phase of STARS is now underway.
To support the large increase of user agencies and radios, the microwave backbone of the
system is undergoing a complete renovation. 	The 87 existing tower sites will grow to 94 sites
and the network is now designed to have alternate paths, or loops, to provide continuously
high reliability in the event of path outage. 		
There are 45 of these tower sites that will be used for the actual two-way communications with
the user's mobile and portable radios. 		
	13 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 14 of 35”
Table: 14
From these sites, the Commonwealth personnel will receive quality, statewide, mobile radio
coverage. STARS will be one of the first geographically statewide systems to employ digital
trunked technology in the VHF 150 MHz band. 		
It will also be one of the first states to employ an Integrated Voice and Data (IV&D) land mobile
radio architecture, which uses the same mobile radio for both voice and law enforcement
computer communications. 	Virginia will, therefore, have statewide mobile data coverage.
Integrating the voice and data networks saves the Commonwealth the expense of a separate
data infrastructure and an additional radio/modem in each vehicle. 	The IV&D infrastructure will
also provide Over-the-Air Re-Keying (OTAR) of the radio encryption, a recent technological
innovation. 	This allows the encryption codes resident in the vehicle’s equipment to be
managed remotely. 					
The digital trunking technology allows different functional groupings of people to communicate
privately within their own organizational elements, known as “talk-groups,” even while other
groups are communicating among themselves. 	As the members move throughout Virginia, the
system will automatically track them so they will not be out of communications with other
members of their group. 				
The digital trunking technology will also be carried a step further for the agencies that use
portable radios while away from their vehicles. STARS will include a Digital-Vehicular- 	
Repeater-System (DVRS), which will translate the VHF signal used between the tower and
vehicle, into a 700 MHz signal used for vehicle-to-portable communications. 	
STARS was operational December 20, 2005, in the Richmond area, which includes four cities
and 21 counties. The STARS Project is scheduled to be implemented over a six-year period.
Operational Stages 					
• 	Richmond 	-- 	December 2005 		
• 	Tidewater 	-- 	May 2008 		
• 	Culpeper 	-- 	July 2008 		
• 	Northern Virginia 	-- 	October 2008 		
• 	Salem 	-- 	April 2009 			
• 	Appomattox 	-- 	May 2009 		
• 	Wytheville 	-- 	September 2009 		
STARS, Motorola, and CTA Communications anticipate statewide implementation will be
completed by June 2008. 			
A single interface link will be provided to each of the counties and independent cities to bring
interoperability at no cost to the jurisdiction. In a wide scale emergency, localities may be
connected to each other in this manner, thus providing regional intercommunications. 	A $1.5
million dollar grant was received to implement an interoperability solution named COMLINC
within 14 counties. 	Grant funding has been applied sought to implement COMLINC statewide.
If successful this will replace the single interface link to each city and county. 	
The implementation of each of these exciting and cutting-edge technologies into STARS will
provide the Commonwealth with critical public safety communications.

	BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 		
	The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all
	criminal matters mandated by statute and established Department policy through
	the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is mandated to investigate any
	matter referred by the Governor. Additionally, the Attorney General, 	
	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs and Grand Juries may
	request the Department to investigate matters, which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3
	felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of elected officials when
	directed by the Governor, Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau 	
	consists of the Criminal Intelligence Division, Support Services Division, Drug
	Enforcement Section, and the General Investigation Section. 		
Criminal Intelligence Division 			
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document, and 	
disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime or terrorism. 	CID is
currently composed of five units and one section – the Analytical Unit, Research Unit, Field 	
Intelligence Unit, Technical Support Unit, Computer Evidence Recovery Unit, Tactical Intelligence
Processing System (TIPS) Section, and the Virginia Fusion Center. 		
CID’s Analytical Unit operates the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), which is a repository
of intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law enforcement personnel. 		
VCIC’s analysts provide research and analytical support to criminal justice agencies. The analysts
assigned use multiple databases and are in daily contact with local, state, and federal organizations
in order to accomplish their mission. 			
The one agent assigned to the Research Unit accomplishes a wide variety of tasks. 	The agent
assists the other CID units with specific research tasks, field investigations including surveillance,
Interpol requests, officer safety issues, and the handling of fictitious identifications for undercover
personnel. 			
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect and supply
intelligence, including information on current investigations. 	The agents also routinely use the 	
Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The unit consists of agents that are placed in
each of the Department’s seven divisions.

Table: 21
In 2005, the Technical Support Unit received 758 requests for service. 	Of those requests 453 were in
support of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each request was directly related to
ongoing criminal investigations, which were supported with the installation of audio and video 	
recording equipment. 	The unit continues to support significant investigations and uses methods and
technologies to assist any requesting law enforcement agency. 	The unit continues to provide audio
enhancement services to all law enforcement agencies, as well as supporting the courts and 	
Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ offices through installation and operation of closed circuit television 	
systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	The Hostage/Barricade Unit program continues to support
state and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated technical equipment. The
Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to five Hostage/Barricade incident requests. 	
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) provides assistance to local, state and federal law
enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for computer-related evidence,
evidence recovery through forensic examination, and quarterly training classes in computer search
and seizure. 	In 2005, the CERU assisted with 72 investigations involving 12,332 gigabytes of data on
143 computers and 844 digital equipment items. 	
The TIPS Section is currently working with law enforcement agencies throughout the Commonwealth
in order to provide them with the Tactical Intelligence Processing System that will allow intelligence to
be entered, stored, and shared with all agencies in the system. 	The TIPS Section is also currently
working with public safety agencies statewide to provide them with the Virginia Critical Information
Shared System, a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that will allow intelligence to be posted on a six-
tiered system. 	The top or first tier of the system will require a Top Secret clearance while the sixth
tier of the system will be able to be viewed by the general public. 	
The Virginia Fusion Center gathers, analyzes and disseminates intelligence as it relates to domestic
and foreign terrorism. 	In 2005, the Fusion Center moved into a new location within the Virginia 	
Emergency Operations Center. 	This joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the Virginia
Department of Emergency Management is the first of its kind in the Commonwealth. Its primary 	
mission is to “fuse” together resources from local, state and federal agencies and private industries to
facilitate information collection, analysis and sharing, in order to prevent or respond to terrorist 	
attacks. 		
CID is also responsible for the Terrorism Hotline, Drug Hotline, and the Domestic Terrorism 	
Tracking/Assessment System. 	The Terrorism Hotline has received 899 calls since its inception in
2001. The Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System was established to assess 	
vulnerabilities and threats related to terrorism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	
Support Services Division (SSD) 		
The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004 as a result of the Department’s 	
reorganization of BCI. The Insurance Fraud Division, Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) and the
Drug Diversion Unit were decentralized and absorbed within SSD. However, the Special Agents 	
assigned to these units have continued their current investigative capacities operating out of their
respective BCI field offices. 		
The SSD is responsible for the law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns and insurance industry
outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) and Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.). 	The
Bomb, Arson Program and Drug Diversion Program also make up the SSD as well as the Counter-Terrorism &
Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI). 	The SSD provides statistical gathering, technical training and financial 	
management support for these units. 	The H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free telephone hotlines are
	21

Table: 22
administered and maintained by the SSD. 	Initial notifications of suspected insurance fraud and auto
theft activities are received via the SSD hotlines, Web sites, e-mails and faxes. 	The notifications are
reviewed and distributed to the appropriate local law enforcement agencies or to the Bureau of
Criminal Investigation’s field offices where investigations are conducted by the Department’s Special
Agents on a case-by-case basis. 				
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 		
Since its establishment on July 1, 2000 by the Virginia General Assembly, the Special Operations
Division (SOD) has undergone a remarkable transformation. SOD’s primary mission was the
interdiction of narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public transportation systems as well as in schools
and businesses. 	SOD provided outstanding assistance to local police departments from around the
state requesting assistance to augment their resources by effectively addressing localized drug and
firearm-related problems/situations that exceeded their existing resources. 	
Due to the events of September 11, 2001, and a recent reorganization within the Virginia State
Police, the Special Operations Division was re-designated as the Special Operations Unit and
expanded its personnel, offices and duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit carried
out the Virginia State Police Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) Homeland Security responsibilities
related to response and recovery operations. 	The seven areas within the unit served to coordinate
the response of other resources and were core members of the Statewide Regional Response
Teams. 						
On January 10, 2003, the name of the unit was changed to the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal
Interdiction Unit (CCI) with fully operational teams in each of the seven traditional State Police
Divisions. 	The area teams were comprised of a Sergeant, a Special Agent, a Trooper, and all
narcotic canine handlers within the geographical boundaries of the area. 	In addition to making each
of the teams fully operational, CCI was assigned the mission to devote resources and efforts in
performing Homeland Security responsibilities, conducting advanced criminal interdiction
investigations, and providing assistance to local law enforcement agencies in communities were the
quality of life for its citizens had been negatively impacted by criminal activities. 	On August 10, 2003,
CCI was transferred to the Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI). 		
In November 2005, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new strategic initiative developed to
diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes. 	CCI provides assistance to local law
enforcement agencies with specially-trained members in identifying gang members and enforcing the
laws of the Commonwealth related to gang violence and illegal criminal activities. 	
The Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit participated in eight successful City/State
Partnerships during the year 2005. 	The statistics for these partnerships are as follows:

Homeland Security - The CCI Homeland Security Unit currently consists of 46 sworn employees
(authorized 49 sworn employees) assigned to eight regional teams, prepared to respond to a terror-
related event to recover evidence and assist other federal, state, and local agencies. 	Currently 45 of
the team members are certified Hazardous Material Technicians trained to enter a scene that may be
contaminated with biological, chemical, or radiological substances. 	Each team is equipped with
detection and monitoring equipment to identify and classify hazardous substances employed during a
terror attack and collect samples for the purposes determining treatment for persons exposed, and
obtaining evidence for prosecution. 	Fifteen of the team members have completed Environmental
Crimes Investigation training provided by the Virginia Department of Fire Programs. 	
Additional training is ongoing to further prepare the teams to deal with terrorist-related bombings,
suicide bombers, radiological attacks, and chemical nerve agent attacks. 	All team members are
being trained to operate within the National Incident Management Systems (NIMS) Incident
Command System. 	The teams attend stakeholder meetings and training with the local Hazardous
Materials Teams and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) Regional
Hazardous Material Officers. 	Our teams also conduct training quarterly to maintain certification
utilizing assigned Personal Protective Equipment and Self Contained Breathing Apparatus.
The unit received seven specialty vehicles in September of 2005 that are equipped with the assigned
radiological detection equipment, Multi-Rae Combustible Gas Indicator equipped with a photo
ionization detector to identify volatile and toxic gases, satellite television, weather monitoring
equipment, emergency decontamination station and a rehabilitation tent. 	The unit also received three
Hazardous Material Identification Instruments that will allow field analysis of liquids and powders.
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 				
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws. The
Section remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these
state laws. 	Seven DES regional field offices also help in this effort by supporting special operations
initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 126 Special Agents available for this purpose.
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support
personnel in six distinct functional areas: 				
• DES Regional Field Offices 					
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 				
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 				
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 				
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 					
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 				
			23 			
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 24 of 35”
Table: 24
From Jan. 1, 2005 through Dec. 31, 2005, DES field offices participated in 2,103 investigations that
yielded $50,964,022 in seized narcotics, $447,367 in seized currency, and 382 persons arrested on
581 felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 824 persons were arrested on 1,178 felony and
misdemeanor charges in cases where DES assisted other agencies. 	Special Agents also seized 47
vehicles and 113 weapons. 		
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DES participates in 22 state and local multi-jurisdictional task
forces, encompassing 81 local jurisdictions. 	Twenty-nine State Police Special Agents and 141 local
officers were assigned to state and local task forces. 	
During 2005, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 3,787 investigations that accounted for
$13,832,091 in illicit drug seizures, $2,739,560 in seized U.S. currency, and 1,832 persons arrested
on 2,539 charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that resulted in 500
persons arrested on 688 charges. 	These task forces also seized 64 vehicles and 187 weapons.
Federal Task Forces – DES participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during 2005. 	Fourteen
State Police Special Agents, as well as officers from local police departments and agents from the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) were assigned. 	The federal joint task forces conducted 133 investigations
that accounted for $34,187,730 in drug seizures and 40 persons arrested on 41 charges. 	These task
forces also assisted with 60 arrests on 135 charges and seized four weapons. 	
Marijuana Eradication Program – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the cultivation of
the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for being a major cash
crop. With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and
local law enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard Reconnaissance Air 	
Interdiction Detachment (RAID), conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically-grown
marijuana. 	The State Police and local law enforcement agencies found 30,384 plants in 302 outdoor
plots. There were also 3,454 marijuana plants eradicated in 54 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication
operations resulted in 196 arrests. 	Seizures included 90 weapons, vehicles, and other personal
property valued at $1,351,892. 	Considering the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each
plant, the cash value of marijuana not reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in
excess of $33.8 million. 		
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to facilitate
and assure coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Six Special Agents are assigned
to GIANT. 	The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 	
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and outdoor,
	with the eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers as a primary goal;
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor suspicious
	activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating clandestine airstrips and
	identifying users; 		
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the Commonwealth by
	interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in communication
	among the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and; 	
		24 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 25 of 35”
Table: 25
5. Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum extent
possible. 		
GIANT performed 393 operations during 2005 that resulted in 249 arrests, and the seizure of
$35,814,330.50 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 102 weapons, 15 vehicles, and $726,523.40
in U.S. currency. 		
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit purposes
continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion predates the massive abuse of
other drugs we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents work with the DEA,
the Department of Health Profession, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local
law enforcement agencies to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes.
During 2005, Drug Diversion received 1,139 complaints of diversion activities throughout the
Commonwealth. 	In response to these complaints, 646 investigations were initiated and the 15
Special Agents assigned to Drug Diversion arrested a total of 356 persons on 630 charges. 	Five
search warrants were executed during the past year. 	
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement officials about the extent
of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it. 	This role also
included educating health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude
of the problem and the importance of self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their individual health
care delivery systems. 	During 2005, one presentation was conducted for 25 healthcare 	
professionals, and three presentations were conducted for 100 individuals in law enforcement.
General Investigation Section (GIS) 	
GIS responds to all complaints referred by the Governor and other complaints that constitutes a Class
1, 2 or 3 felony. Other requests for investigations are discretionary but major emphasis is placed on
responding to requests from the Attorney General, Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Grand Juries, Chiefs
of Police and Sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth. 	
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement agencies.
Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state to ensure that
adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable time. 	
The GIS has 192 authorized positions, of which 141 are Special Agents assigned to conduct
investigations. The remaining 57 positions are supervisors and support personnel. During 2005, GIS
conducted 3,492 investigations, of which 1,705, or 49%, resulted from requests from other law
enforcement agencies. GIS Special Agents made a total of 2,323 arrests. 	
Crime Scene Examination – The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the Division
of Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called upon by other State Police employees and by
local law enforcement agencies to examine and evaluate evidence at crime scenes. 	In 2005, 429
scenes were examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, arson, burglary, and numerous other major
crimes. 		
Fugitive Apprehension – Eight Special Agents and one Trooper/Agent staff Fugitive Apprehension.
There are two Special Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension in the Richmond Field Office, one
Special Agent and one Trooper/Agent assigned to the Fairfax Field Office, and one Special Agent at
the Appomattox, Chesapeake, Culpeper, Salem, and Wytheville field offices. 	
	25 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 26 of 35”
Table: 26
The Fugitive Apprehension mission is to affect the swift apprehension of all fugitives, particularly in
connection with violent crimes. Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension work closely with local and
federal law enforcement agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2005, members were assigned 448
cases and made 725 arrests. 		
National White-Collar Crime Center – The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation is
the Department’s representative to the National White-Collar Crime Center, a federally-funded
program with 1,921 member agencies and 166 associate member agencies throughout the country.
Members of the center assist with the investigation and prosecution of various white-collar crimes.
Polygraph – There are 22 Special Agents trained as examiners who administer polygraph
examinations upon request. During 2005, 726 criminal polygraphs were conducted. 	
Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – During 2005, this unit investigated 213 cases which included
154 requests from other agencies. 	A total of 135 arrests were recorded for the year. 	
The Violent Crimes Investigative Unit opened 106 cases for the year. Four cases were entered into
the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP), which is a national database established by the
U. S. Department of Justice and maintained by the FBI. The Special Agent assigned to this unit also
presented 110 programs relating to homicides, sex crimes and hostage negotiations. 	
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 32 trained hostage negotiators available for
hostage or barricade situations. 	During 2005, the negotiators trained 11 times with local law
enforcement and State Police tactical teams. 	They responded to 25 barricaded subject situations.
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – This Unit consists of 11 High Technology Crimes Special Agents.
The Cyber Crime agents opened 266 cases in 2005, involving a variety of investigations for this
Department and other local and federal agencies. 	
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant, who is assigned to the Support Services Division, is the chief
arson investigator and coordinates activities between the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other
investigative agencies throughout the state. 		
Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by localities. 	During 2005,
the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in providing the following training related to arson
investigations and explosives related matters: 	
. 	Investigators attend a weeklong Arson Investigation School from statewide law enforcement,
	fire services and insurance agencies. 	
. 	Training sessions are conducted exclusively for local fire services departments in the
	recognition and detection of incendiary fires. 	
. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling bomb threats, bomb
	scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices. 	
. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and blast 	
	characteristics for law enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, conferences, and
	academies. 		
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically trained to
investigate arson-related matters. 	In 2005, GIS conducted 406 fire scene investigations. 	Of these
investigations, 76 were determined to be incendiary in origin, 51 were determined to be accidental,
and 162 were of an undetermined origin. 		
		26 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 27 of 35”
Table: 27
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 41 trained bomb technicians assigned to the
GIS. 	In 2005, there were 339 explosives-related incidents requiring the GIS to respond and provide
explosives-related expertise. 	During 2005, there were 31 actual explosive devices rendered safe and
138 hoax and suspicious items requiring examination by bomb technicians. 	
Bomb technicians continue to present bomb threat presentations to school staffs throughout the
Commonwealth. 		
Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents are funded by the Help
Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program. 	A total of eight Special Agents are assigned to Richmond,
Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake, Salem, and Fairfax divisions. These Special Agents
work closely with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance Crimes Bureau,
and federal and local law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-
shops, insurance fraud and other illegal activity. 	
In 2005, the eight Special Agents conducted 174 motor vehicle theft investigations, resulting in 40
arrests and the recovery of 77 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment with a combined value
of $700,729. They also received more than 438 requests for assistance from federal, state, and local
law enforcement agencies. 		
Auto Theft Agents coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft investigators and
insurance company special investigative units across the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These
meetings are held to discuss current automobile theft trends and coordinate enforcement efforts
among law enforcement agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide auto theft investigation
training to numerous Troopers and local law-enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police
Academy and regional academies. 		
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program is an
insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-414 of the Code of Virginia.
The Program was established in 1992 to receive and reward auto theft related tips. 	Callers who
provide information that leads to the arrest of individuals for auto theft related crimes become eligible
for cash rewards. 	On January 1, 2005 the maximum reward increased from $10,000 to $25,000.
Annually, 10 to 12 citizens earn H.E.A.T. rewards by helping the police. 	
The Department’s H.E.A.T. Program provides leadership to over 165 state and local police and sheriff
agencies working cooperatively to reduce auto theft throughout Virginia. 	During 2005, the H.E.A.T.
staff consisted of a first sergeant, two special agents, one trooper-agent, two program support
technicians and one analyst. 	H.E.A.T. personnel support auto theft reduction efforts by providing
training, conducting promotional events, conducting prevention/VIN Etching events, offering grant
funding, procuring specialized equipment, coordinating monthly meetings of regional auto theft
investigators, providing Department of Motor Vehicles’ documentation to support prosecutions and by
assembling auto theft statistical information. 	Over 140 title searches were completed for auto theft
investigators in the United States and Canada. 	
H.E.A.T. conducts two basic and one advanced auto theft investigation school for law enforcement
annually. 	In 2005, H.E.A.T. and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association implemented a new 16-
hour auto theft prevention school which will be offered to crime prevention specialists and Operation
HEATWave Coordinators four times per year. The H.E.A.T. office also began the production of five
bait cars that will be employed in high theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves.

Table: 28
The H.E.A.T. Program works with Neathawk Dubuque and Packett, a private marketing agency, to
increase the public’s awareness about the problem of auto theft, auto theft prevention devices and
strategies, the H.E.A.T. Program, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-HEAT) and cash rewards of up to
$25,000. 	Citizens are directed to the H.E.A.T. Web Site at: www.heatreward.com, for additional
H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The public is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they ever
learn of any auto theft related information. 	In addition, H.E.A.T. promotional messages run
throughout Virginia on television, radio, billboards, newspapers and on three NASCAR race cars.
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted in a momentous
reduction in Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000
inhabitants has declined by approximately 30%. 	Working together to protect cars by employing the
“Layered Approach to Protection” and educating the public regarding the toll-free hotline to increase
tips has proven to be an effective strategy to make Virginia a safer place to own and operate a motor
vehicle. 			
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved
establishing an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Department of State Police, Bureau
of Criminal Investigation. In 2003, the General Assembly lifted the sunset clause making the
Insurance Fraud Program a permanent unit of the Department. The purposes of this Unit are
threefold: 		
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the Department has
	reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently being committed, and to
	undertake studies to determine the extent of such insurance fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state and
	local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units, and any other
	person; 		
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud that, in its
	judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations.
Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging burglaries, fraudulently
reporting theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation injuries. 	
The IFP is constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving claim
funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as
represented by the total amount of claimed loss that was actually received by individuals submitting
suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2005, more than $3.6 million was actually collected by
individuals suspected of insurance fraud and the total amount involved in suspicious claims that was
attempted, but not collected, was $7.5 million. 		
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household approximately $200
in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the increased cost of goods
and services. This Program is dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the
law-abiding citizens of Virginia. The hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected
insurance fraud receives frequent activity. The toll-free telephone number is: 	1-877-62FRAUD.
In 2005, 2,155 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward program has been
established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or
conviction of individuals committing insurance fraud. IFP operates the reward program by use of the
insurance fraud hotline and through information obtained during investigations and provided by the
		28

Table: 29
general public. A reward committee has been selected to make recommendations based on written
policy and procedures. Their recommendations are forwarded through channels to the
Superintendent for final approval. 		
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of insurance fraud to
the general public, law enforcement, the insurance industry and media. 	A portion of the Web site
provides the insurance industry and the general public the capability to report incidents of suspected
insurance fraud directly to the Insurance Fraud Program on line. This service is available through the
Department’s Web site and www.stampoutfraud.com 	
There are currently 20 Special Agents assigned to investigate insurance fraud. 	Their primary focus is
on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2-178,
obtaining money under false pretense. The law now requires that if insurance professionals have
reason to believe that someone is violating or will be violating this statute, they are compelled to
disclose this information to the Department of State Police. 	
During 2005, more than 1,638 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance fraud were
received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and the general public. There were
357 criminal investigations initiated by the Special Agents and 306 arrests for insurance fraud and
related offenses. 	Ninety-three insurance fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court-
ordered restitution of $745,822 during 2005. 	
	BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 	
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000 miles of
state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	Uniformed State Police personnel
provide both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the
ability of local law enforcement to respond. 	The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor
Vehicle Safety Inspection Program regarding the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial
vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides aerial support for law enforcement
activities and emergency medical evacuations. 	
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police services
into seven field divisions. 		
These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or more cities
and/or counties. 	Manpower is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county level.
Enforcement Initiatives to Address Highway Safety 	
Checkpoint Strikeforce 		
Identifying and removing drunk drivers from the highways of the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia is a primary objective of the State Police in their 	
goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation. Checkpoint 	
Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that involves 	
saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on specific 	
highways and in locations where alcohol related incidents and arrests have 	
been identified. This national campaign is supported by the National 	
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and involves significant 	
public education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 	
	29

Table: 30
Trooper Bowl 		
Trooper Bowl is a high visibility DUI enforcement initiative that has spread throughout the
Commonwealth. 	It kicked off following a successful initial program conducted on Interstate 66 and its
corridor following the NFL Super Bowl. The primary objective of Trooper Bowl is to identify and arrest
motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and jeopardizing highway safety.
Click-it-or-Ticket 		
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the primary functions of
this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen an increase in safety belt use over the past
three years to an historic high in 2005, of 80.4 %. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness,
education, and enforcement to gain compliance with existing safety belt laws. Increasing the use of
safety belts and child safety seats have statistically shown to decrease deaths and serious injuries
resulting from traffic crashes. 	
Smooth Operator 		
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative, which aims to provide education,
information and solutions for the problem of aggressive driving. For nearly 10 years, Maryland,
Virginia and Washington, D.C., have partnered through the Smooth Operator Program to combat
aggressive driving. Law enforcement agencies, trauma experts, government officials and other
professionals have worked together to educate motorists of the risks involved with aggressive driving,
and to stigmatize aggressive driving behavior on our roads. 	
Operation Cruise Control 		
Effective July 1, 2005, the State Police implemented “Operation Cruise Control” to increase visibility
and enforcement efforts to address all types of violations and the reckless operations of a vehicle on
Interstate 81 from our border with Tennessee to the West Virginia state line. 	During the first six
months of operations troopers devoted 1,407 additional hours of patrol to Interstate 81 resulting in
more than 2,000 traffic summonses and 54 criminal arrests. From the traffic arrests made, 1,300 were
for speed violations and 307 arrests were made for reckless driving. 	
Operation C.A.R.E. 		
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major holidays of Memorial
Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are the primary purposes of the Combined
Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.). 	
During these major holiday periods that are noted for increased highway travel, the Department
maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address highway safety and promote travel
safety throughout the Commonwealth. 	
Highway Safety Corridors 		
Two additional highway safety corridors were established during 2005, to enhance highway safety on
Virginia Interstates. 	Highway safety corridors were established in the Richmond metropolitan area
and in Prince William County on Interstate 95. The corridors are determined based on statistical crash
data that identifies specific sections of a highway to have a higher than normal crash rate when
compared to other segments of the same highway. Establishing the Highway Safety Corridor allows
the courts to impose higher penalties for violations cited by police for traffic violations and criminal
offenses. 	A comparison of crash data for 2005 and 2005 for the Highway Safety Corridor established
on Interstate 81 in Roanoke revealed a 29% reduction in total crashes and a 37% reduction in fatal
and personal injury crashes. 	Enforcement statistics indicated a 57% increase in arrests for reckless
driving arrests in the corridor, and a reduction of 22% for speeding commercial vehicles in the safety
corridor. Overall enforcement increased by 16 percent for the two year comparison.

Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 	
During 2005, each of the Department’s seven field divisions implemented a unique enforcement
program to increase enforcement and visibility on primary and secondary highways within the
counties in their divisions. Each division’s program focused resources on those highways where
crashes, traffic violations, and citizen complaints regarding traffic were noted. The objectives of this
initiative were to prevent crashes, reduce violations, and address the concerns citizens identified as
threats to their safety. 		
Hurricane Katrina Response 		
In response to the devastation to the Gulf Coast states and their communities left in the wake of
Hurricane Katrina, the Department spearheaded an initiative to provide law enforcement resources to
aid in the restoration of communities and the enforcement of the law. The Virginia State Police
provided helicopter support immediately following the storm and provided several contingents of State
Police Troopers and specialty equipment to disaster stricken areas to enforce all state and local laws.
This arrangement allowed local law enforcement personnel sufficient time to address their personal
needs and the needs of their families. 		
Safety Division 		
As of December 31, 2005 there were 4,227 active inspection stations located throughout the
Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 13,997 licensed safety inspectors who performed
approximately 7,745,000 inspections at appointed stations during 2005. 	Approximately 21%
(1,626,450 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components.
This Division investigated 2,367 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,031 instances of
disciplinary action against 216 stations for various classes of offenses and the suspension of 67
inspection stations. 	These statistics include administrative errors made by inspection stations, and
the majority of errors/ complaints were corrected by counseling sessions.
Disciplinary action was also taken against 534 safety inspectors, resulting in 176 suspensions.
Safety Division personnel also conducted 1,549 business security checks.
Motor Carrier Safety 		
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety requirements on
Virginia's highways. 	Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present
lectures to the public and other interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials
regulations. They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training seminars.
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 43 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2005 and
conducted 207 post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents.
Data indicates that during 2005, Troopers conducted 32,247 in-depth inspections on heavy
commercial vehicles and 7,837 of these, or 24.3 percent, were placed out of service for violations of
regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of hazardous materials.
Field Support 		
Safety Division sworn employees provided support for local field divisions during all major C.A.R.E.
holidays. 	During 2005, Safety Division Troopers had 3,236 arrests/summonses issued, investigated
48 motor vehicle crashes, assisted local Troopers with the investigation of 155 motor vehicle crashes,
and assisted 2,920 disabled motorists.

used for medical evacuation operations. The Department also has four Cessna 182 airplanes.
Medical Evacuation 	
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve Central and
Southwest Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced medical procedures, and
transportation of critically injured patients to a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs
serve 43 hospitals and the citizens residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began
operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Richmond,
Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1, 1987 and responds to calls for assistance in a
60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began operations on September 1, 2000, and
responds to calls for assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and
in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. In 2005, all 3 programs responded to a total of 1,745 requests with
1,111 patients transported. The total number of flights for all three programs from April 1, 1984 to
December 31, 2005 was 17,627 responses to calls with 12,306 patients transported as a result of
these calls. 	
Search and Rescue 	
During 2005, the Aviation Unit responded to 397 requests for searches for escapees, missing
persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward Looking Infra-Red system on two
helicopters and a 30 million-candlepower searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has been
successful in locating fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. During this period the Unit also
recovered 2 missing vehicles. 	As a result, 6 arrests were made.

Roanoke/Salem areas. 	During 2005, motorist assistance aides provided assistance to disabled or
stranded motorist on more than 83,843 occasions. 	
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires, providing gasoline,
jump-starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone calls for additional assistance or to
notify family members of a stranded motorist's situation. 	Motorist Assistance Aides also were
instrumental in the arrest of drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting erratic driving behavior
to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension. 	
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 		
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary responsibilities
include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the highways of the
Commonwealth. 	During 2005, approximately 19.8 million commercial vehicles passed through
Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for inspection. 	Through the inspection of these vehicles and
through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 65,834
summonses and made 165 criminal arrests. 	This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway safety
program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized vehicles; through
assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and through
the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a
commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 		
Crime Prevention 		
During 2005, the Department provided specialized training to selected troopers throughout the State
in crime prevention and personal safety. 	Participating troopers received training in "Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design" (CPTED), business security and techniques to promote personal
safety. 	All training was part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to
achieve certification through the Department of Criminal Justice Services as crime prevention
specialists. 		
During 2005, approximately 187,000 citizens of Virginia were contacted through 3,433 various
programs conducted and nearly 66,000 informational handouts were distributed by certified crime
prevention troopers. Troopers conducted 542 crime prevention programs and 944 Safety Programs.
In addition 176 programs were conducted to address personal safety, 51 programs addressed the
issues of road rage, 25 workplace violence workshops were held, and 20 programs were sponsored
