THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF STATE POLICE
SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE
The Superintendent, with the rank of Colonel, is appointed by the Governor and serves
as agency head of the Virginia Department of State Police. On June 22, Gov. Jim
Gilmore appointed Col. W. Gerald Massengill as Superintendent to replace Col. M.
Wayne Huggins, who resigned Jan. 28 to accept employment in the private sector.
The Department is divided primarily into three Bureaus: Administrative and Support
Services, Criminal Investigation, and Field Operations. The Superintendent’s Office
includes the Professional Standards Unit and the Public Affairs Unit.
Professional Standards Unit
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs, internal audit,
and staff inspection functions within the Department of State Police.
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations
of misconduct on the part of Department employees. During 2000, 891 internal
investigations were processed.
The Internal Audit Section provides the Department with independent and objective
audits and reviews of Department operations. During 2000, the section provided 15
comprehensive reports of operating sections within the Department. The reports
included recommendations for strengthening internal controls.
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components
within the Department. Eight staff inspections were conducted in 2000.
Public Affairs Unit
The Public Affairs Unit (PAU) maintains daily contact with the public and media,
disseminates news releases about Department programs and activities, develops and
implements public awareness programs, and answers questions on many topics.
Personnel in this unit often respond to the scenes of major highway and criminal
incidents to assist the media in providing information to the public. The staff includes the

and public relations coordinators deployed in field division headquarters in Chesapeake,
Fairfax, and Richmond. A fourth field position deployed in Salem was approved and a
coordinator was hired in 2000.
Public and media relations, information and education are important elements of the
Public Affairs Unit. 	
Other duties of this Unit include:
• 	Promoting transportation safety
• 	Coordinating press conferences on Department programs, activities or incidents
• 	Conducting media interviews
• 	Writing news releases
• 	Coordinating speaking engagements for sworn personnel
• 	Developing and implementing highway safety campaigns

	BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATIVE
	AND SUPPORT SERVICES
The Bureau of Administrative and Support Services is comprised of most of the
Department’s non-sworn personnel as well as some sworn employees. The Bureau
includes the Divisions of Communications, Criminal Justice Information Services, Data
Processing, Personnel, Property and Finance, Training, and a Planning and Research
Unit. 	
Employees in these areas provide the Department, especially troopers and special
agents in the field, with essential services through their extensive technical and
professional expertise. These services range from:
• 	Purchasing and configuring personal computers ... to designing complex and
	sophisticated computerized systems to maintain critical criminal files;
• 	Installing police radios and radar units in patrol vehicles ... to designing and
	implementing a Computer-Aided Dispatch System;
• 	Employing a qualified and diversified work force ... to managing an exciting volunteer
	program;

Table: 3
• 	Managing and maintaining Department buildings and grounds across the State ... to
	preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the Department’s annual budget;
• 	Providing criminal justice agencies with rapid access to local, state and national
	criminal justice files ... to supervising Virginia’s Firearms Transaction Program;
• 	Ensuring that all sworn employees meet mandated training requirements ... to
	overseeing the State’s Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Program; and
• 	Conducting research into innovative law enforcement techniques and products ... to
	coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grant management programs.
The Bureau also develops and proposes legislation involving traffic safety and criminal
statutes, serves as liaison during General Assembly sessions for discussion of issues.
Communications Division
Responsibility for the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of telephone, land
mobile radio, and microwave radios is assigned to the Communications Division. Under
the command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates,
and maintains land mobile radios, microwave radios, and private telephone networks.
The system includes 87 microwave radio sites, 46 of which also have land mobile radio
base stations. This responsibility includes compliance with requirements of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible
for: 	
• 	Maintaining mobile radios;
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios;
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, antennas and emergency power
	plants;
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices;
• 	Installing and maintaining equipment, telephones, and other telecommunications at
	Administrative Headquarters; and
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field Division for mobile and fixed
	communications equipment.
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. Of the 23 sites
considered to be the backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to
digital service. The FCC assigned 2 GHz microwave frequencies that the Department
had been using to companies providing Personal Communications Services (PCS). PCS
providers were required to relocate incumbent microwave users at no expense. Work is
underway to relocate the last of the microwave stations affected by this change.
Cooperative development or co-location agreements continue to fund equipment
upgrades from analog to digital microwave system. Five additional sections of the
system are presently planned for upgrade. The total worth of these co-location and
relocation agreements has saved the Department over $7 million over the past five
years. Work in progress will save another $750,000.

Table: 4
The Division is supporting all field efforts of the consultant selected to design and
engineer the upgraded State Police land mobile radio network that will serve all of the
Commonwealth’s state level public safety agencies. Licenses have been obtained from
the FCC for the necessary frequencies, and planning continues.
The Division is conducting a pilot phase of mobile computer terminals (MCTs) to be
used for messaging and routine drivers’ licenses checks and vehicle registrations. This
project is the first to utilize a dual mode commercial wireless service to provide
automatically the most economical operation for the troopers and widest possible
coverage. An NIJ COPS Grant funded the project. The next phase will equip troopers
with 400 mobile units and will be combined with the Shared Land Mobile Radio Project.
The Division continues to provide communications support for special events as they
occur. Such activities include communications systems to support security for visiting
dignitaries, National Drag Races in Dinwiddie County and the State Fair of Virginia in
Richmond.
The Division supports telephone and local area network wiring requirements statewide
for the Department, as well as other State agencies. At the present time, in excess of
5,000 items of equipment are being maintained for six additional agencies. The Division
also continues to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most of the
State’s public safety agencies. The Communications Division has actively participated
with the Capital Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and Public Safety Wireless
Network (PSWN) activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington,
D.C., area.
Criminal Justice Information Services Division
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the
maintenance of all files within the Department. This includes the implementation,
monitoring, destruction and archiving of records in accordance with the Records
Retention Schedule. The Division also acts as the point-of-contact and liaison with the
Library of Virginia. The Division processed and responded to 2,158 subpoenas and 90
Freedom of Information Act requests in 2000.
Central Criminal Records Exchange – The Criminal Investigative Reports Section
received and processed 34,230 investigative reports in 2000.
Staff of the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) automated 3,542
non-computerized criminal records in calendar year 2000, leaving a total of 165,121
misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated.
The Supreme Court/State Police disposition interface consists of 242 Circuit and
General District Courts, transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. In 2000, a total of
142,077 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-
222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. In February, the arrest/disposition monitoring
system was implemented. Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are
automatically generated for rejected disposition transactions and/or missing arrest
fingerprint records. Since its inception, a total of 9,677 notifications have been
generated. The majority of these letters were generated because the court did/could not
4

Table: 5
transmit the Document Control Number. There were 16.6% court disposition rejections
for the year. 	
The Non-criminal Justice Name-Search program continues to experience growth,
with 312,046 inquiries processed in 2000. The demand for the service has increased
312% in the past 10 years. The Non-criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented
Feb. 8, 1996, to effectively address the demand. The NCJI eliminates the requirement
for CCRE staff to receive and process “paper record name-search requests.” 	As of
Dec. 31, there were 57,171 electronic name-search transmissions received from
participants, with an average response time of 72 hours or less since implementation.
The mental health file records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on
file the ability to purchase a firearm(s). Official notifications of individuals in these
categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual
being incompetent, involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. There were 4,158
mental health records added, bringing the total records on file to 34,638. 	
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry –The Sex Offender Registry
(SOR) includes 9,304 fingerprint-based registrations received since July 1, 1998. The
Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by providing
personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of certain sex
crimes. Photographs of offenders are available, and violent offender registrations are
maintained on the Internet. There were 51,813 searches conducted against the Registry
for employment-licensure purposes in 2000. During 2000, the SOR verified the address
of 9,205 sex offenders, and initiated 4,553 criminal investigations to the field divisions.
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) interface was developed to comply with
Section 19.2-390, Paragraph (E), of the Code of Virginia. Information received from the
Department of Corrections updates the criminal record name file with active 	
probation/parole statuses. Staffs from the departments of State Police and Corrections
are working in a combined effort to expand CSI by 71 additional statuses, including the
status action date. It is anticipated this record improvement initiative will be implemented
by May 1, 2001. The information will identify an inmate’s authorized or unauthorized
release from and return to custody, and be directly connected to the commitment record
in CCH. As of Dec. 31, an estimated 53,640 CSI (probationer/parolee) transactions were
forwarded to the State Police. Of these, 14,565 (27%) were not accepted due to being
duplicate transactions. 	
The Microfilm Section staff archived 1,073,831 documents during this calendar year.
Photographic Laboratory –The Photo Lab maintained records, files, film, and
responded to 650 letters of requests for photographs. Additionally, 173,316 	
photographic prints were developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and
prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases. 	
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) is a shared state and local
computer system. The Department and 22 state and local agencies have access to the
system through terminals located in their agencies. There are 1,307,727 fingerprint
cards and 44,489 unsolved latents on the database. During 2000, there were 1,172
suspects identified as a result of searches on the AFIS system.

Table: 6
The Department’s LiveScan Network installed in local agencies, electronically captures
and transmits arrest and fingerprint information to the State Police and FBI, where it is
searched on AFIS as it is received. This provides for the detection of aliases and
outstanding warrants, before arrested persons are released. LiveScan equipment is
currently installed in 40 local agencies and one correctional reception center. It is
anticipated that ten additional LiveScan sites will be installed in 2001.
During 2000, the fingerprint section processed 225,853 criminal, 84,171 applicant and
1,070 sex offender fingerprint cards.
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) –The VFTP provides for the approval
at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based on the results of a criminal
history record information check on the buyer. In 2000, 182,170 firearm transactions
were conducted. Of these, 2,568 were disapproved and 143 wanted persons were
identified with 98 arrests reported. Also, in 2000, the State Police made 677 criminal
arrests based on the illegal purchase, or attempted purchase, of a firearm. Certificates
for 373 multiple handgun purchases were issued authorizing the purchase of more than
one handgun within any 30-day period.
The Direct Access program has been tremendously successful with statistics indicating
the current on-site terminal dealers handled approximately 31% of the transactions
processed through the Firearms Transaction Center (FTC) during 2000. The FTC will
continue to expand the Direct Access program via additional participating dealer
locations. As on-line users increase, staff is diverted from telephoned firearm
transactions to research and verification processes. Additional employee time devoted
to these processes provides more efficient overall services to the firearm dealers and
gun buying public.
The FTC maintains 5,673 machine gun registrations. Additionally, the FTC maintains the
Criminal Firearms Clearinghouse, a central repository of information regarding all
firearms seized, forfeited, found or otherwise coming into the possession of any law
enforcement officer that are believed to have been used in committing a crime. In 2000,
4,696 reports were made to the Clearinghouse. Also, the State Police entered 12,302
concealed handgun permits into the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN). Since
July 1, 1995, a total of 156,788 permits has been entered into VCIN.
Uniform Crime Reporting – The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is
responsible for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all
contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different crime
offenses. During 2000, 18 agencies became certified for IBR submission bringing the
total IBR agencies to 257. These agencies represent 93% of the total UCR contributing
agencies and 99% of the total population of Virginia. The UCR office no longer accepts
summary hard copy reports. Data is submitted by diskettes that are scanned, copied,
and uploaded to the mainframe. Approximately four times a month, this data is run
through the edit process, which generates an error report for the agencies to correct any
incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database. A monthly tape of
Virginia’s data is generated and sent to the FBI.

Table: 7
During 2000, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues,
interpretation of error reports and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting
procedures, as well as assisting vendors with reporting issues. There are now 16 private
vendors representing IBR certified agencies. Several large agencies have built their own
in-house software systems. Quarterly agency data reports were mailed to each
contributing law enforcement agency. The UCR office responded to approximately five
to ten requests daily for crime statistics.
Statewide training sessions were held in the fall in seven different sites in Virginia.
Approximately 400 local law enforcement personnel were provided uniform instructions
and training in IBR.
Statistical crime data are published in the CJIS Newsletter and in the annual report,
Crime in Virginia, which is distributed to contributing agencies, commonwealth’s
attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state agencies. The report is available to the
public for a nominal fee. The 1999 Annual Report, published in June 2000, was the first
publication containing IBR data. Staff members have been diligent during the year
informing the media and the public of the new reporting system, and that comparisons
to previous years should not be made.
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN)/National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) – The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 622 member agencies with 4,133
terminals. Of these, 2,081 terminals are non-mobile, and 2,052 are mobile terminals. In
1999, VCIN processed in excess of 191,000,000 transactions between NCIC/NLETS
member agencies and state computer databases. This system processes messages
and/or transactions in approximately three seconds.
Virginia agencies have entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC
system, which is critical to law enforcement officers. As an example, these systems
stored information relating to wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles.
VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia information relating to 40,156 wanted persons, 950
missing persons, and 10,523 stolen vehicles.
In July, the Department completed the conversion from the dedicated terminal system to
the personal computer based (TCP/IP) protocol. This new protocol has permitted new
agencies to connect and existing agencies to expand their number of terminals. The
VCIN conversion prepared agencies in Virginia to participate in NCIC 2000. It is still the
intent of the Department to access NCIC 2000. The first phase will be fully operational
by July 2002. The Department has started to convert all the files over to the new NCIC
2000 program. The Department has authorized specialty Units Dial-up Access into the
VCIN system. The Department has explored the new Cyberlinxx software package as a
method of accessing the VCIN system for inquiries only.
The Department has authorized installing new hardware in all the area offices to support
the Cyberlinxx software. Completion date for this is April 30, 2001. This software is
browser based and uses existing state networks as a means of accessing the VCIN
system. Currently, there are 50 new agencies in the process of purchasing the
Cyberlinxx License. To this date, 15 agencies have purchased Cyberlinxx software with
eight agencies on line. This system will be utilized first by the Department of Social
Services, Child Support Enforcement Section, county treasurers, and county
7

Table: 8
commissioners of revenue to inquire on Virginia and other selected states’ vehicle
registration files. As with all new technology, the Department will be required to develop
strict guidelines to ensure the integrity of the VCIN/NCIC system is not compromised.
Data Processing Division
The Data Processing Division operates one of the largest computer centers in state
government. Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by
equipment and software provided by BULL Information Systems, NEC Corporation and
UNISYS Corporation. The Division operates two separate computer rooms 24 hours a
day.
NATMS/CCH Interface – The Criminal History/Automated Fingerprint Identification
System (AFIS)/Remote LiveScan Interface (CHARLI) was placed into production and
now receives over 2,925 arrest records per week from 40 LiveScan agencies. CHARLI
uses TCP/IP program-to-program control to allow the Unisys ClearPath IX 4400
mainframe to communicate with the UNIX Networked AFIS Transaction Management
System (NATMS). NEC Corporation developed NATMS to Virginia’s specifications to
store and forward arrest records to the Computerized Criminal History System and to
the Automated Fingerprint Identification System. An unsolicited VCIN message is
returned to the originating agency with the results (state identification number) of the
fingerprint check. A Card Scan Interface also was placed into production to handle those
arrest records, which are still mailed to the Central Criminal Records Exchange. Over
4,110 arrest prints are transmitted to the FBI weekly. Identification messages from the
FBI are sent to LiveScan agencies over VCIN within two hours of the booking.
CAD/MIS – The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for
rapid entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. The
CAD system consists of 15 servers, 42 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote access
users. A total of 1,294,733 incidents were entered into the CAD system in 2000. The
dispatch terminals operating system was upgraded to Windows NT Workstation 4.0.
The CAD servers in three divisions were moved out of the Communications Centers.
Three new dispatch terminals were installed. Equipment was purchased to install a CAD
network printer in each area office to allow users of any Division CAD system to print to
any area office in the state. One network printer has been set up and tested in Fairfax.
Eighty programs were changed to create new CAD functionality, such as logging every
VCIN transaction with the requesting unit’s badge number, automatically delivering any
phone messages on file for on duty units to the dispatchers, and several new VCIN
query commands.
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) was placed into
production in June. This database currently has CAD information back to March1999.
CAD historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. The data base currently holds in
excess of five million records. An Intranet web page allows VSP network users to create
custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. The web page also allows
user access to weekly and monthly reports. The MIS database allows the Department to
track and access information never before available, such as average response times,
total number of calls, and average workloads.

The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource
management, with continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying
the work force. 		
Recruitment Section –The Department recruited for entry-level law enforcement
positions for the 101st 	Basic Session during November and December 1999, and
January 2000. This resulted in 1,426 applications. The fifth administration of the new
trooper entrance test was held in April 2000, and 418 applicants participated. Applicants
are being further processed for the 101st 	Basic School scheduled to begin 	March 10,
2001.

December. 		
The Employment Section advertised 325 sworn and non-sworn positions (254 full-time
and 71 part-time) during 2000. In addition to the 77 trooper trainees hired, three full-time
sworn positions, 66 full-time non-sworn positions, and 64 part-time positions were filled
during this same period. 		
The Department continued a Mediation Program for all agency employees. The
Employment Section processed 30 grievances during 2000. 	
During 2000, 51 volunteers gave 7,521.3 hours of their time in locations throughout the
State. Volunteers who had served in 1999 were honored at a recognition event on April
11. 			
During 2000, the Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section
processed 141 hires, 140 promotions, 233 transfers, 127 separations and a number of
address and name changes. A large number of records inquiries was received including
employment history inquiries, legal inquiries from financial institutions, Freedom of
Information Act inquiries, and other routine information requests.

Classification completed studies on Surplus Property, Food Services, Canine Handlers,
Aviation Pilots, Communications and the Purchase and Stores Operations. A new
division, Special Operations, was established in the Bureau of Field Operations, and a
new position for Deputy Superintendent was established. In addition, a new Cybercrime
Unit was established, the Nurse Practitioner position was audited, and a study of the
Data Processing Division was completed.
Altogether, 53 classified position action requests were received, one from the
Superintendent, 18 from the Bureau of Field Operations, five from the Bureau of
Criminal Investigation, five from Data Processing, seven from Criminal Justice
Information Services, six from Communications, six from Property and Finance, six from
Personnel, two from the Professional Standards Unit and one from Public Affairs.
In addition, during that same period, 22 wage positions were established, 11 salary
surveys were completed, one differential pay study was approved, and numerous
classification inquiries from other agencies were answered.
A departmental Salary Administration Plan was developed on Dec. 1, and the
Department implemented Compensation Reform to include broad band pay scales and
the conversion of job classes to roles.
Planning and Research Unit
The Planning and Research Unit provides planning and policy support to all divisions of
the Department and is responsible for:
1. 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies;
2. 	Updating staffing formulas;
3. 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies;
4. 	Providing support for developing grant applications and budgetary submissions;
5. 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan;
6. 	Maintaining departmental manuals; and
7. 	Monitoring the Department’s budgeting performance measures.
The Unit also is responsible coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants
management programs and the mandates on local government.
During 2000, the Unit completed seven comprehensive studies of agency programs and
operations and six evaluations of new law enforcement equipment/technologies. In
addition, pursuant to Executive Order 51 (99), the Unit was responsible for developing
the Department’s web enablement plan. At the end of the year, the Unit was monitoring
26 grants that provide approximately $14.3 million for agency projects.
Accreditation – The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of
law enforcement services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in
compliance with generally accepted standards. Accreditation requires a comprehensive
review of every aspect of the Department’s organization, operations, and administration.
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in
the nation to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement
Agencies (CALEA), Inc. In 1991 and again in 1996, the Department achieved
	10
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 11 of 28”
Table: 11
reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review by CALEA assessors of the
agency’s policies, procedures, and operations.
During 2001, the Department again will undergo reaccreditation on-site assessment.
Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for all accredited law enforcement
agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of policies and
procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement
accreditation standards.
Property and Finance Division
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial and property
management functions. It is responsible for preparing, monitoring, and accounting for
the Department's annual operating budget, which was in excess of $177,861,610 for
fiscal year 2000. It was responsible for procuring, warehousing, and distributing more
than $20,062,109 in supplies and equipment. The Property and Finance Division also is
responsible for managing and maintaining more than 69 buildings and grounds across
the State.
During 2000, the Area 6 Office construction project in Powhatan was completed.
Construction is underway for addition/renovations to the Area 2, Warsaw, and Area 3,
West Point, offices. Planning and design is proceeding on the Area 31, Melfa; Area 43,
Danville and Area 38, Clifton Forge, office projects. Design work is continuing for the
addition to the Administrative Headquarters Building.
In addition to its property and financial management duties, the Division oversees the
mailroom and printing section, which processed 453,012 pieces of mail and printed
more than 10,250,000 copies during 2000. It also manages the garage, which is
responsible for equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately 1,800 vehicles.
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military
Property Program which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no
cost, military property and equipment that is in excess of the Department of Defense
needs. The Department was appointed by the Governor to serve as the state
coordinator for the program. The program serves over 200 Virginia law enforcement
agencies and in 2000 the program distributed over $3.5 million.
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day
operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The
1122 Program.” This program allows state and local law enforcement agencies to
purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic activities through the
federal procurement channels at substantial savings. State and local law enforcement
agency purchases since inception of the 1122 program, through Dec. 31, totaled
$3,035,431.24 with a savings of $1,094,795.87 over retail pricing.
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act was established by Public Law 105-181, and
provides $25 million per year for federal fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 to assist law
enforcement agencies with the purchase of ballistic vests. The Director of the Bureau of
Justice Assistance (BJA) is authorized to grant law enforcement and correctional
agencies up to half (50%) of the cost of ballistic vests purchased during these three

BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all criminal
matters mandated by statute and established Department policy through the Bureau of
Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is mandated to investigate any matter referred by the
Governor. The Attorney General, commonwealth’s attorneys, chiefs of police, sheriffs
and grand juries may request the Department to investigate matters, which constitute
Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of elected officials
when directed by the Governor, Attorney General or grand juries. The Bureau consists
of the Divisions of Criminal Intelligence, Drug Enforcement, General Investigations and
Insurance Fraud.
Criminal Intelligence Division (CID)
The primary purpose of the Criminal intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document,
and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime
and terrorist groups. The CID is composed of three units: Research Unit, the Analytical
Unit, which includes the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), and the Technical
Support Unit.
The CID operates the VCIC, a repository of intelligence information that is available to
all Virginia law enforcement personnel. VCIC personnel provide research and analytical
support to criminal justice agencies.
CID also is responsible for the Virginia Narcotic Pointer Index system, the Help
Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Hotline, the Drug Violation Hotline and the Insurance Fraud
Hotline. During 2000, VCIC personnel processed 578 hotline calls.
CID administers the Witness Protection Program for the Department, providing both
funding and technical assistance for the protection of threatened witnesses in the
Commonwealth. The Witness Protection Program assisted in protecting 10 witnesses
during 2000 from jurisdictions throughout the state.
Technical Support Unit – In 2000, the Technical Support Unit received 727 requests
for service. Of those requests 632 were in support of federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies. Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal
investigations that were supported with the installation of technical equipment. The Unit
continues to support significant investigations being conducted for requesting law
enforcement agencies.
The Unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement
agencies, as well as supporting the courts and commonwealth’s attorneys’ offices
through installation and operation of closed circuit television systems for victims of child
abuse cases.
The Hostage/Barricade Unit and Witness Protection Program were developed to support
state and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated technical
14

Table: 15
equipment. The Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to 19 Hostage/Barricade incident
requests in 2000.
Drug Enforcement Division (DED)
DED continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance
abuse laws. The Division remains committed to its support of local law enforcement
agencies’ efforts to enforce these same laws.
DED’s mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian
support personnel in eight distinct functional areas:
• 	DED Regional Field Offices
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces
• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Narcotics Interdiction Unit
• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam
• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations
• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit
• 	Asset Forfeiture
DED Regional Field Offices – Seven DED Regional Field Offices perform operational
narcotics enforcement investigations, as well as support special operations (undercover,
wire intercept, marijuana eradication), initiated by other law enforcement entities. Of the
114 special agents available for enforcement and task force duties at seven field offices,
57 perform routine enforcement duties, and 57 are assigned to task forces or to other
special assignments.
From Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, the field offices participated in 1,780 investigations that
yielded $23,127,888 in seized narcotics; $525,796 in seized currency; and 596 persons
arrested on 737 felony and misdemeanor charges. In addition, 432 persons were
arrested on 510 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DED assisted other
agencies. DED also seized 17 vehicles and 89 weapons.
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DED participates in 25 state/local multi-
jurisdictional task forces, encompassing 93 local jurisdictions. Thirty State Police special
agents and 137 local officers were assigned to state/local task forces.
During 2000, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 3,237 investigations that
accounted for $14,694,178 in illicit drug seizures; $1.6 million in seized U.S. currency;
and 1,723 persons arrested on 2,211 charges. In addition, task forces assisted their
agencies in cases that resulted in 397 persons arrested on 508 charges. These task
forces also seized 38 vehicles and 119 weapons.
Federal Task Forces – DED participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during
2000. Nine State Police special agents, as well as officers from local police departments
and agents from Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), were assigned. The federal
joint task forces conducted 24 investigations that accounted for $459,280 in drug
seizures, $112,100 in seized U.S. currency, and 45 persons arrested on 55 charges.
	15
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 28”
Table: 16
These task forces also assisted in 43 arrests on 68 charges. Two vehicles and one
weapon were seized.
Multi-jurisdictional Narcotics Interdiction Unit – On Sept. 24, 1996, the State Police
formed the Richmond Metro Interdiction Narcotics Task Force, including Chesterfield
County, Henrico County, Richmond and Petersburg Police Departments, Hanover
County Sheriff’s Office, Richmond International Airport Police Department, and the DEA.
In 2000, the Task Force seized 352 pounds of marijuana, 21 pounds of cocaine, 11 lbs.,
9 ounces of heroin, and one pound of methamphetamine, along with LSD, hydrocodone,
ketamine, ecstasy, and steroids, all having a street value of over $3.2 million. Seventy-
one suspects were arrested on 126 charges. Fourteen firearms and $780,977.00 in U.S.
currency also were seized.
Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam – The Commonwealth remains a prime
location for the cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown
marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop. With DEA funding, the
Department of State Police, along with assistance of other state and local law
enforcement agencies, conduct a regular program to eradicate domestically grown
marijuana. During Operation Grand Slam in 2000, State Police and local law
enforcement agencies found 12,400 plants in 116 outdoor plots. Marijuana eradication
operations resulted in 230 arrests. Seizures included seven weapons, vehicles, and
other personal property valued at $5,800. Considering the estimated yield of
consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not reaching the
streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $12.4 million.
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is
to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Five
special agents are assigned to GIANT. The five facets of the GIANT mission are:
1. 	Development of 	intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor
	and outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the
	growers as a primary goal of GIANT;
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to
	monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by
	locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users;
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway;
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in
	communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities,
	and; 	
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum
	extent possible. 	
Six hundred eighteen GIANT operations during this period resulted in 225 arrests, the
seizure of $16.2 million worth of narcotics, 43 weapons, and $1,111 in U.S. currency.

Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to
illicit purposes continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion
predates the massive abuse of other drugs we know so well today. The Pharmaceutical
Drug Diversion Unit works with the DEA, the Department of Health Professions, and the
Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies, to
eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs to illicit purposes.
During 2000, the unit received 1,399 complaints of diversion activities throughout the
Commonwealth. In responses to these complaints, 877 investigations were initiated and
the 13 special agents assigned to the Unit arrested a total of 134 persons on 819
charges. Of the 134 persons arrested, 34 were licensed health care professionals.
Fourteen search warrants were executed during the past year.
A major educational role of the unit is teaching local law enforcement officials about the
extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do
about it. This role also included educating health care professionals, both physicians
and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and the importance of self-
policing and insuring the integrity of their individual health care delivery systems. During
2000, 13 presentations were conducted for 248 health care professionals and seven
presentations were conducted for an audience of 567 law enforcement personnel.
General Investigations Division (GID)
GID responds to complaints about violations that constitute Class 1, 2 and 3 felonies,
investigations are discretionary. Major emphasis is placed on responding to requests
from the Governor, Attorney General, commonwealth’s attorneys, grand juries, and
chiefs of police and sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth.
A major priority of the GID is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement
agencies. Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the
state in order that adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable time.
The Division has 185 authorized positions, of which 133 are special agents actually
assigned to conduct investigations. The remaining 52 positions are supervisors and
support personnel. During 2000, GID conducted 4,708 investigations, of which 3,046 or
56.2 percent of the total were a result of requests from other enforcement agencies.
Special agents made 2,645 arrests.
GID headquarters personnel are responsible for the day-to-day coordination of
investigations occurring throughout the state and related administrative matters. Duties
of headquarters personnel also include the following:
Arson Investigation – A lieutenant is the chief arson investigator and coordinates
activities between the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other investigative agencies
throughout the state. Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when
requested by localities. During 2000, the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in
providing the following training related to arson investigations and explosive related
matters:
• 	A weeklong Arson Investigation School attended by investigators from statewide law
	enforcement, fire services and insurance agencies.

	and detection of incendiary fires.
• 	Training sessions across the state for officers on handling bomb threats, bomb
	scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices.
• 	Explosives recognition and blast characteristics training and demonstrations for law
	enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, conferences and academies.
Within the Bureau there are a number of special agents who have been specifically
trained to investigate arson-related matters. Of the 4,708 GID investigations conducted
by the Division in 2000, 186 were fire investigations of incendiary origin, 116 fire cases
were investigated which were found to be accidental and 200 more undetermined origin.
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 42 trained bomb technicians
assigned to the Division. During 2000, there were 195 actual explosive devices rendered
safe and 89 hoax and suspicious items requiring examination by bomb technicians.
There were 350 explosives-related incidents requiring the Division to respond and
provide explosives-related expertise.
The Office of the Chief Arson Investigator assisted the 4-SAFE VA Program with a
Bomb Threat Presentation to be presented to school staff throughout the
Commonwealth. Bomb technicians in each field office were trained and have presented
several presentations around the state.
Auto Theft Unit – The Auto Theft Unit consists of a total of nine special agents
assigned to Richmond, Culpeper, Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake, Salem and
Fairfax with a secretary and a supervisor assigned to GID Headquarters. Members of
the unit work closely with the Department of Motor Vehicles, National Insurance Crimes
Bureau, and federal and local law-enforcement investigating crimes related to auto theft
rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other illegal activity.
In 2000, members of the Unit investigated 425 cases, resulting in 71 arrests and the
recovery of 232 stolen vehicles and 69 pieces of stolen construction, off-road equipment
and stolen parts. The total value of these recoveries was
$2,845.615.
Unit members responded to 519 calls for assistance from other law-enforcement
members and certain members of the Unit provided auto theft investigation training to
more than 180 troopers and local law-enforcement officers. Members of this Unit also
coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft investigators and insurance
company special investigative units in order to stay abreast of current theft trends and
coordinate enforcement efforts.
Crime Scene Examination – The Division is staffed with crime scene technicians
trained by the Division of Forensic Science. The technicians are often called upon by
other State Police employees and by local law enforcement agencies to examine and
evaluate evidence at the crime scene. In 2000, 701 scenes were examined in cases of
murder, rape, robbery, arson, burglary and numerous other major crimes.

polygraph examination upon request. During 2000, 842 criminal polygraphs were
conducted. 	
Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – This Unit has 10 special agents assigned to field
offices around the state. Agents opened 43 cases in 2000 with 31 opened as a result of
requests from local law enforcement agencies.
One agent is assigned to the Unit to conduct criminal investigative analysis and assisted
law enforcement throughout Virginia with 14 cases involving homicides, sexual assaults,
threat assessments, equivocal death investigations and false allegations. This agent
also presented 40 programs to law enforcement agencies on criminal investigative
analysis, hostage negotiation, school violence, and workplace violence.
The Virginia Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) is under the Violent
Crimes Investigative Unit. During 2000, 18 homicide cases were entered into VICAP,
bringing the total cases in the system as of the end of the year to 666.
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 43 trained hostage negotiators
available for hostage or barricade situations. The negotiators trained on several
occasions with the Department of Corrections, local law-enforcement agencies and the
State Police tactical teams. 	
Insurance Fraud Division (IFD)
Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved establishing an Insurance Fraud
Investigative Unit within the Department of State Police, Bureau of Criminal
Investigation. The purposes of this Unit are threefold:
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the
	Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is
	currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent of such
	insurance fraud;
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal,
	state and local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or
	Units, and any other person;
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected
	fraud that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the
	investigations.
IFD currently has 14 special agents located strategically throughout the state. Their
primary focus is on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence
violate Section 18.2-178, taking money under false pretenses. The law now requires
that if insurance professionals have reason to believe that someone is violating this
statute, they are compelled to disclose this information to the Department of State
Police. Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking accidents, staging burglaries,
fraudulently reporting theft and Workers’ Compensation injuries. The Division is
constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving
claim funds from insurance carriers. 	
	20
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 21 of 28”
Table: 21
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured citizen approximately
$200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the cost of
goods and services. This new Division is dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent
insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of Virginia. A hotline for persons to call in
with information about suspected insurance fraud has been established. The toll-free
telephone number is: 	
	1-877-62FRAUD.
Last year there were 23 calls received through the toll free hotline service. A reward
program is being considered to provide a monthly reward for information leading to the
arrest and/or conviction of individuals committing insurance fraud. An Internet web site
has been completed to provide information on the various aspects of insurance fraud to
the general public and other interested parties. The address is:
	www.stampoutfraud.com
Investigative Results – 	During 2000, the Insurance Fraud Division received 662
notifications of potential property and casualty insurance fraud from the insurance
industry, law enforcement agencies and the general public. There were 232 criminal
investigations initiated resulting in 73 cases prosecuted, which led to 119 criminal
charges being placed for insurance fraud and related offenses. Courts ordered
restitution in the amount of $329,151.
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total
amount of claimed loss that was actually received by individuals submitting suspected
insurance fraud claims. During 2000, in cases handled by the Insurance Fraud Division,
there was over $3 million that was actually collected by individuals suspected of
insurance fraud while $4.7 million in claims was attempted. Many attempts failed due to
the efforts by the insurance industry and law enforcement to prevent these losses.
An electronic reporting system has been established whereby the insurance industry
and the general public can report incidents of suspected insurance fraud directly to the
Insurance Fraud Division on line. This service is available through the Department’s and
the stampoutfraud.com Internet web sites.
BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS
The primary responsibility of the Bureau of Field Operations is the patrolling of over
64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. Uniformed
State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as
the need arises and based upon the ability of local law enforcement to respond. The
Bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program,
enforcing motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Special
Operations Division. 	
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed
police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further subdivided into 48
	21

Table: 22
State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or counties. Manpower is
allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county level.
Special Operations Division (SOD) – The Special Operations Division was established
on July 1, 2000, pursuant to Governor Gilmore’s S.A.B.R.E. Initiative in the 2000
Session of the Virginia General Assembly. The primary activities of this Division include
highway narcotics interdiction, surveillance of public transportation systems, and
narcotic canine sweeps of parcels, schools, and vehicles. The Division also is
responsible for assisting local police departments in high crime, drug-infested areas.
With the Division currently in the developmental stage, there are three highway narcotic
interdiction teams. Since July 1, these teams made a total of 297 drug arrests, which
included 149 felony charges. In addition, they arrested seven fugitives, one bank robber,
one felony parole violator and seized 21 weapons. Illegal narcotics consisting of LSD

personnel.
The Tidewater Interdiction Team, along with Bureau of Field Operations Division V,
began a 90-day project on Sept. 18, 2000, in Newport News. After a one-week
familiarization of the area, six troopers and two sergeants began enforcement
operations on Sept. 25. This operation began phasing out on Dec. 15, with the
personnel working only one to two days per week until March 2001. The team has made
162 arrests, seized $41,813.00 of narcotics, seized $6,823 in U.S. currency and seized
18 weapons. The team also assisted Newport News Police Department on 350
incidents.
At the request of Petersburg Acting Chief of Police Morris Jones, an intensified patrol
project in the Petersburg area began Oct. 19 and continued for Thursday and Friday
nights for one month. An evaluation of the project was made after the one-month period,
and at various dates and times, SOD personnel were scheduled to work with the
Petersburg Police Department’s Street Crimes Unit. Five troopers and one sergeant
from the Special Operations Division and Bureau of Field Operations Division I
participated. To date, the team has made 112 arrests and summons, seized $4,133
worth of narcotics, seized $2,285 in U.S. currency, and seized three weapons.

a firearm and possession of marijuana. Six vessels were put out of service for safety
violations.
At the request of the Colonial Beach Chief of Police, intensified patrol efforts were
undertaken by the East (Richmond) Interdiction Team in Colonial Beach on Sept. 23.
Between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m., combined patrols with the local police were conducted, in
conjunction with an intensified checking detail by Division I troopers and two
Westmoreland County deputies. Arrests for possession of marijuana, driving under the
influence and drunk in public were affected, along with traffic infractions. One runaway
child was located, and city officers enforced one curfew violation.
At the request of King George Sheriff’s Department, intensified patrol efforts were
undertaken by the East (Richmond) Interdiction Team on Dec. 7. During this effort,
combined patrols with the Sheriff’s Department were conducted on U.S. Rt. 301 in King
George County. Fourteen vehicles and one residence were searched for narcotics,
resulting in six charges against three individuals. Further, 11 traffic summons were
issued following 40 traffic stops.
Seized were various amounts of marijuana, some believed to be laced with
phenylcyclohexyl piperdine (PCP), two smoking devices, $3,287 in U.S. currency, and
one vehicle. Information garnered from the traffic stop assisted the East Interdiction
Team and Public Transportation Team with enough information to obtain search
warrants for a residence in Manassas. Another individual from which narcotics were
seized was found to have left a newborn baby alone at his apartment. That individual
also was charged with felony child endangerment.
In addition, SOD personnel assisted BCI and numerous police department and sheriff’s
departments with various requests for service.
Operation Alert – Operation Alert is a program especially designed to interdict criminal
activity on the highways of Virginia. Specialized training is provided to troopers to
heighten their awareness when engaged in traffic stops and during public contacts
urging the trooper to look for unusual circumstances that typically indicate criminal
conduct and activity.
The Department's efforts in Operation Alert during 2000 resulted in troopers making a
total of 15,535 Operation Alert traffic stops that resulted in 6,064 arrests and the filing of
4,426 criminal charges. Sworn personnel removed an estimated $2,727,918 worth of
narcotics and dangerous drugs from the highways of the Commonwealth. In addition,
troopers seized $271,164 in currency and 246 weapons as a result of the Department's
enforcement effort.
Aviation Unit – The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on Jan. 1, 1984, to provide
for the administration and coordination of the Department’s aviation resources. The Unit
operates six helicopters and four airplanes from four bases located in Lynchburg,
Manassas, Abingdon, and Richmond. The Unit’s primary mission is to provide aircraft

for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical evacuation. During its 17-year
existence the Aviation Unit has recorded 67,098 flight hours responding to 39,687 flight
requests.
The Department currently has a contract to replace the four Bell 206 helicopters with
Bell 407 helicopters. The new Bell helicopters are expected to be delivered beginning in
February 2001. Also on contract to purchase is an American Eurocopter Corporation
BK-117 helicopter for medical evacuation operations. This helicopter is expected to be
delivered in August 2001.
Medical Evacuation –The Department operates two helicopter medical evacuation
programs that serve Central and Southwest Virginia. These programs provide rapid
response, advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients
to a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 34 hospitals and the
citizens residing in 47 counties and 21 cities.
Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to calls for assistance in a
60-mile radius of Richmond. Med-Flight II began operations on Jan. 1, 1987, and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon.
In 2000, both programs responded to a total of 959 requests with 660 patients
transported. The total number of flights for both programs from April 1, 1984, to Dec. 31,
2000, was 10,603 responses to calls with 7,668 patients transported as a result of these
calls. A third medical evacuation program, Med-Flight III, is anticipated to become
operational on Sept. 1, 2001. This program will respond to calls for assistance
predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and in a 60-mile radius
of Lynchburg as requested.
Search and Rescue – During 2000, the Aviation Unit responded to 293 requests for
searches for escapees, missing persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a
Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) system on one helicopter and a 30 million-
candlepower searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has been successful in
locating fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. During this period, the Unit also
recovered two missing vehicles. As a result, eight arrests were made.
Surveillance – The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2000,
the Unit was requested 23 times for drug or narcotic surveillance, 36 times for other
criminal matters and 54 miscellaneous calls. As a result, three arrests were made and
2,961 marijuana plants were located at a value of $2,961,000.
Other Duties – The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any federal, state, or
municipal agency whereby the solution of a police problem or mission may be obtained.
During 2000, the Unit provided aerial support to 157 agencies external to the
Department of State Police. These flights included photographing crime scenes,
providing support for presidential motorcades, participating in multi-agency task force
efforts, and demonstrations of the capabilities of the Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between
Jan. 1, and Dec. 31, 2000, the Aviation Unit flew 3,591 hours responding to 2,468 flight

Also, during 2000, a major initiative continued at Virginia’s 41 rest areas and welcome
centers to promote both travel safety and personal safety. Crime prevention signs at
each rest area location were maintained and brochures were distributed to enhance
safety at these facilities and throughout the Commonwealth. More than 800,000
brochures have been distributed through this initiative.
Specialty Teams – Each of the seven field divisions deploys tactical teams, canine
teams and SCUBA teams. These teams are available 24 hours a day to assist local law
enforcement agencies or State Police personnel. Tactical teams assist in executing
high-risk search or arrest warrants and in dealing with hostage situations. Canine teams
are available to track lost persons or fugitives, search for suspects of crimes, and detect
illegal drugs or explosives. SCUBA teams are used to recover drowning victims or
evidence of criminal activity.
In 2000, Patrol Canine Teams responded to 257 requests of which 102 were from
Department personnel and 155 were from other state and local law enforcement
agencies. These requests resulted in 95 felony and 17 misdemeanor arrests.
