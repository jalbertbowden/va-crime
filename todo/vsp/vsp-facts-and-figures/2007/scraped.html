A Message from the
Superintendent.....
The year of 2007 was one of great triumphs and
tragedy for the Virginia Department of State Police. The
Virginia State Police celebrated its 75th anniversary and the
milestone of fulfilling its mission of serving the citizens of
the Commonwealth with superior valor, service, and pride
since 1932. State Police participated in America’s 400th Anniversary Celebration
at Jamestown by providing traffic control and security for the event, as well as
for the President of the United States and the Queen of England. Our troopers
continued to receive rave reviews from the motoring public on their outstanding
efforts and dedication to highway safety and traffic safety operations.
It was also in 2007 that Virginia State Police responded to and investigated
the horrific events of April 16 on the Virginia Tech campus. With 400 sworn and
civ ilian personnel deployed to this tragic incident, the daily demands placed on
those troopers and supervisors who remained back at the Areas and
Divisions were overwhelming, to say the least. Yet, no one complained and
these troopers and supervisors did a commendable job of stepping up to the
task and maintaining the Virginia State Police highway presence and
response that our citizens have come to expect of us.
Despite last year’s many high-profile assignments and demands
placed upon a sworn population already stretched thin, the Virginia State
Police remained focused on its mission to save lives on our highways. I
am most proud of the outstanding enforcement efforts put forth every
day by our Department. I am equally proud of our investigators within
the Bureau of Criminal Investigation who meticulously piece together
evidence daily helping to solve hundreds of cases involving drugs,
fraud, murder and other violent crimes. We are fortunate to have such a
strong and dedicated civilian support staff to aid the Department in
effectively accomplishing our jobs in th e field.
As your Superintendent of State Police, I am pleased to present to the public
the 2007 Facts and Figures Report which details the work and
accomplishments of the men and women of this Department. As we
continue to serve and protect the citizens of this fine Commonwealth, than k
you for your interest in what we do.
Sincerely,
W. Steven Flaherty

The Virginia Department of State Police is divided primarily into three Bureaus: 	
Administrative and Support Services, Criminal Investigation, and Field Operations. 	
Each Bureau Director, who holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, reports directly to the 	
Deputy Superintendent. 		
The Superintendent’s Office includes the Executive Protective Unit, Professional 	
Standards Unit, the Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls, and the 	
Public Relations Office. 		
Professional Standards Unit 		
The Professional Standards Unit is responsible for the internal affairs and staff inspection
functions within the Department of State Police. 		
The Internal Affairs Section conducts and coordinates the investigations of allegations of
misconduct on the part of Department employees. 	During 2007, 682 internal 	
investigations were processed. 		
The Staff Inspection Section conducts inspections of all organizational components within
the Department, ensuring compliance with National Accreditation Standards, OSHA 	
requirements, and Department policies and procedures. 	Six staff inspections were 	
conducted in 2007. 	The Staff Inspection Section also manages all records retention and
destruction within the Department. 		
Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls 	
Established in March 2007, the Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls
(OPMIC) was created to track and monitor progress on the objectives established in the 	
Virginia Performs performance management system and to ensure compliance with 	
standards developed by central government oversight agencies. 	OPMIC is also tasked
with managing Agency Risk Management and Internal Control Standards for the 	
Department. 	OPMIC is comprised of the Internal Audit Section and the Planning and 	
Research Section.

purpose of monitoring the agency’s performance in maximizing the efficiency and 	
		1
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 53”
Table: 7
effectiveness of Department operations and strengthening internal controls. Internal 	
auditors follow professional auditing standards and carry out the scope of their work in an
independent and objective manner. Results of all internal audits are reported to 	
management and the Superintendent, along with relevant recommendations for 	
improvement. Some of the common types of internal audits include: 	
• 	Review of the reliability of financial data and related financial reporting of operations
• 	Review of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures
• 	Audits of various operational areas or programs within the Department
• 	Reviews of the safeguarding of assets and the prevention/detection of losses, errors,
	or irregularities
• 	Audits of information technology systems and related security of data
• 	Investigations of State Employee Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Hotline complaint referrals
• 	Review or testing of the Department’s compliance with the Agency Risk Management
	and Internal Controls Standards (ARMICS)
Planning and Research 	
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all divisions 	
and units of the Department and is responsible for: 	
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, and technologies
• 	Updating staffing formulas
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs

Accreditation 	
In August 2007, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by the 	
Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The Department 	
was fully compliant with the accreditation standards and received many favorable reviews
from the “public input” component of the evaluation. 	
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA, as the 	
Department, in 1985, became the second state law-enforcement agency in the nation to 	
receive official accreditation by CALEA. 	
	2
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 53”
Table: 8
Maintaining accredited status is an on-going project for all accredited law enforcement
agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of policies and 	
procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement 	
standards. 	In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven agencies awarded a
Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully maintaining accredited status for
over 15 years. 				
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement
services by demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally
accepted standards. 	Accreditation requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of
the Department’s organization, operations, and administration. 	
Public Relations Office 		
The Public Relations Office (PRO) is responsible for planning, developing, managing and
implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations information and
educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to maintaining daily contact

Table: 11
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 	
Program Director by providing engineering, maintenance, inventory control, asset 		
management, configuration management, and operations services. 	The Division also 	
identifies and migrates the existing State Police mobile data, land mobile and microwave 	
radio networks that will be upgraded to serve all of the Commonwealth’s state-level public
safety and service agencies. 	The Division staffs the STARS Network Operations Center 	
and help desk 24/7. 												
The Communications Division is currently maintaining 320 legacy mobile computer 	
terminals (MCT) with commercial wireless CDMA 1X RTT service for messaging; VCIN, 	
NCIC and NLETS access; and interoperability through terminal to terminal messaging 	
with participating agencies. 		The STARS project now being implemented is providing a 	
private data network with statewide geographical coverage currently to which units can 	
operate mobile computer terminals through the radio. 	Legacy mobile data use has now 	
been expanded to the entire I-81 corridor and other secondary routes parallel to the 	
interstate due to the increased wireless coverage provided by the 1X RTT commercial 	
technology. 													
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid entry
and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The CAD system
consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote access users. 	A total
of 	983,925 	incidents 	were 	entered 	into 	the 	CAD 	system 	in 	2007. 	A 	total 	of 	35,806
incidents were created by Troopers using mobile computer terminals. 	A real time data
feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate rapid response to incidents impacting
traffic. 													
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) is a database 	
containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD since March 1999. 	CAD 	
historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. 	The database currently holds in excess of 6 	
million records. 	An Intranet web page allows VSP network users to create custom 	
queries to obtain desired data from the database. The web page also allows user access 	
to weekly and monthly reports. The MIS database allows the Department to track and 	
access information never before available, such as average response times, total number
of calls, and average workloads. 										
The 	Mobile 	Management 		System 	provides 	support 	for 	over 	1,000 	vehicle 	terminals
currently deployed. The users supported include troopers, other state agencies, and local
sheriff’s offices and police departments. This system allows user access to VCIN/NCIC,
text messaging, and for the troopers, full CAD functionality. 						
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with 	
new copper and fiber optic service. 	Telephone system upgrades are continuing as 	
needed at area offices and division headquarters statewide. 						
In addition to mission-critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates 	
and supports wireless communications equipment and services from public networks. 	
The Division is currently upgrading wireless services to provide better coverage and 	
														6

Table: 12
increased technical support. 	This effort supports the current mandated budget reductions
with significant savings to the Department of State police and the taxpayers in the 	
Commonwealth. These services make Department personnel more accessible and keep
them better informed regarding routine and administrative activities. 	The number of 	
wireless telephones approved and in use has exceeded 1,100 units and 1,177 pagers. 	
Current cellular services will allow the elimination of pagers in most areas of operations. 	
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for 	
special events as they occur. 								
During 2007 events includes: 								
1. 	Two presidential visits to the Commonwealth 					
2. 	A visit from the Queen of England 						
3. 	Communications to support security for other visiting dignitaries 		
4. 	Jamestown 400 th anniversary 								
5. 	Communications 	to 	support 	other 	events 	where 	large 	groups 	of 	
	spectators gather over short periods of time such as the State Fair and 	
	a number of NASCAR and other races. 						
All field division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by the Division of 	
Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating 2,800 radar tuning forks. The 	
present inventory of active radars is approximately 1,421 units and 108 lidar units. 	The
majority of Department radars are newer Golden Eagle II units. 			
The Division provides statewide telephone services and wiring for local area network 	
wiring requirements for the Department and other state agencies. At the present time, in 	
excess of 5,000 items of equipment are being maintained for 6 additional agencies. The 	
Division also continues to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio equipment for most
of the state’s public safety agencies. 	The Division will be responsible for over 60,000 	
items of STARS equipment for all participating agencies. 	Depot level repair is performed
in the Communications Division, a great savings over all other alternatives. 		
The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless 	
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN) activities to improve
interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 				
The Communications Division serves as the Virginia’s Frequency Advisor for the 	
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO), the Federal 		
Communications Commission’s designated agent. 	The duties include: 		
• 	Preparation of initial FCC new and modified license applications for localities and 	
	agencies throughout the Commonwealth as requested 				
• 	Coordinate applications processed through APCO headquarters with regards to 	
	spectrum efficiency, coverage needs, protection of Commonwealth incumbents, 	
	and conformance to regulations

• 	Review to accept or deny, applications processed through other coordinating 	
	agencies for protection of Commonwealth incumbents, and conformance to 	
	regulations 	
• 	Review to accept or deny, applications from states adjacent to the Commonwealth
	for interference protection of Commonwealth incumbents

Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of 	
all files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction,
and archiving of records in accordance with the State Police Records Retention 	
Schedule. 	
In 2007, the Division processed and responded to 2,943 subpoenas and 69 Freedom of 	
Information Act requests. 	
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 	
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 303,600 investigative
reports in 2007. 	
Non-Criminal Justice Program (NCJ) 	
The Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 87,287 fingerprint based searches
and 263,804 name search requests for 2007. 	On February 8, 1996, the Non Criminal
Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant growth and demand for 	
criminal history record requests. 	The NCJI can be accessed through the Department’s
website. 	This interface eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process
a high volume of “paper record name-search” requests. 	
In 2007, CCRE staff processed 96,288 or 36.5% paper inquiries and 167,516 or 63.5% 	
electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average response time 	
of 72 hours or less. 	Of the total paper record name search requests, 68,282 inquiries
were submitted on the bar-coded criminal history request forms and the remaining 28,006
were submitted on the non bar-coded forms. 	The bar coded method of automation has
tremendously enhanced customer service by reducing turn around time. 	
Mental Health File 	
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to 	
purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these categories are received
from clerks of courts upon court adjudication of an individual being incompetent, 	
involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. 	As of December 31, 2007, there were
11,347 mental health records added bringing the total records on file to 89,509. 	
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 	
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for 	
employment-licensure purposes had a slight decrease. 	
		8
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 15 of 53”
Table: 14
9 	The SOR experienced a 4 % decrease. 	
9 	In 2007, there were 179,181 searches. 	
9 	A loss of 8,003 searches compared to 2006. 	
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by 	
providing personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals convicted of 	
certain sex crimes. 	Information regarding registered offenders which includes a 	
photograph is maintained on the internet. 	
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 17,279 fingerprint-based registrations 	
received since July 1, 1997. 	
9 	Fingerprint registrations grew 10.2% from 2006 to 2007. 	
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual offenders. 	
Registered offenders require semi-annual address verification and an additional 	
verification within thirty days of a change to their home or employment addresses 	
information. 	During 2007, troopers confirmed 15,714 addresses which is an increase of 	
13,821 from the previous year. 	
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit also initiates criminal investigations related to 	
offenders required to register. 	
9 	In 2007, 3,638 criminal investigations were initiated. 	
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 	
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts, and 124 	
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	
In 2007, an estimated 436,954 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to 	
submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions
transmitted, an estimated 16% were rejected. 	
In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented. 	Designed
to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated for missing arrest
fingerprint cards. 		
For 2007, notifications for 25,701 individual charges were generated. 	The majority of
notifications (88%) were generated because the court did/could not include the Document
Control Number when transmitting their data. 	The remaining notifications (12%) were
generated when the court transmitted the Document Control Number, but CCRE did not 	
have a corresponding fingerprint card on file. 	
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 	
As of December 31, 2007, there were 211,158 offenders on file with commitments 	
received from the Virginia Department of Corrections, which accounts for 11.9% of the 	
offenders on file. 	The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive 	
		9

Table: 15
Correctional Status Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status Information
Interface improved the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional
information with minimal error. 		
The Microfilm Section 		
This section archived 968,275 documents during 2007. 	
Photographic Laboratory 		
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for photographs,
digital images, and court enlargements. 	Additionally, there were 132,470 photographic
prints, an increase of 2.7%, developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and
prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases in 2007. 	The lab also processed
236 compact discs (CD’s) due to digital camera use. 		
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 	
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and partial latent
fingerprints recovered from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are
located at State Police Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 24 other state
and local agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their 	
respective agencies. 	The newly acquired Global Transaction Controller receives Live
Scan transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS
systems for searching and updates. 	The installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive
System has enhanced our ability in the storage and retrieval of fingerprint records. 	
Currently, there were 1,239,169 Virginia SID folders created in the Electronic Archive
System. 		
Currently, there are 1,807,780 ten-print fingerprint records on file and 98,003 unsolved
latent fingerprints in the database; also, the Slap database has 465,916 images, the Palm
database has 3,489. 	In 2006, there were 2,825 suspects identified as a result of 	
successful latent print searches on the AFIS system. 	We no longer track latent hits.
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest and
fingerprint information to the State Police and the FBI, which has enhanced the agencies
ability to detect aliases and outstanding warrants on arrestees prior to their release.
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 		
Currently, there are 294 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 355 Live Scan units. 	In
addition, there are 335 Live Scan sites utilizing 276 Live Scan Units. 	A total of 59 criminal
Live Scan sites are submitting criminal justice and concealed weapon applicant 	
information via Live Scan. 	The following is a brief comparison of statistics. 	
The following percentages reflect the increase or decrease in 2007.

Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 	
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques,
based on the results of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2007,
225,289 firearm transactions were conducted, which is a .5% increase in transactions 	
conducted during 2006. 	Of these, 2,222 were denied based on the result of a criminal 	
history record information check. 	During 2007, 169 wanted persons were identified, 	
which resulted in the arrest of 61 individuals wanted in Virginia, and the arrest of 14 	
individuals who were named in an outstanding warrant from another state. 	In 2007, the
State Police requested 853 criminal investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to
purchase firearms, of which 690 (70%) resulted in closed arrests. 	
VCheck 		
VCheck is Virginia’s Internet based Instant Background Check program, which was 	
introduced to all firearms dealers registered with the State Police Firearms Transaction 	
Center (FTC) on August 1, 2006. 	Approval numbers are generated in instant clearances,
while transactions that require review or research are routed to the FTC for processing. 	
During calendar year 2007, approximately 55% of the total transactions, statewide, were
processed via the Internet. 	As online users increase, staff is diverted from telephonic 	
firearm transactions to research and verification processes. 	Additional employee time
devoted to these other processes provide more efficient overall services to the firearm 	
dealers and firearm purchasers and cost savings to the Department and the 	
Commonwealth. 		
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun 	
dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification 	
number for qualified employees. 		
As of December 31, 2007, the State Police issued 8,143 seller identification numbers. 	
Concealed Handgun Permits 		
Since July 1, 1995, 351,928 concealed handgun permits were issued as authorized by 	
Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 41,472 were issued in 2007 (39% increase) by 	
Virginia Circuit Courts. 	During 2007, 502 nonresident concealed handgun permits were 	
issued by the State Police. 		
		11
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 18 of 53”
Table: 17
Pursuant to statute, the State Police enters the permit holder’s name and description in 	
the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) so that the permit's existence and 	
current status will be made known to law-enforcement personnel accessing the Network
for investigative purposes. 		
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 		
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident
Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout 	
the state on 46 different crime offenses, comprising what are known as Group “A” 	
offenses and 13 additional offenses , Group “B” offenses, 	reported only when arrests are
made. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hardcopy reports. 	Data is submitted
either by diskette or via the Internet. 	The diskettes and Internet files are submitted 	
through the IBR Web site. 	This is a secure system to which only State Program 	
personnel and contributing agencies have access. 	Each day submitted files are run 	
through the edit process. 	This procedure generates an error report so that agencies may
correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database. 	A
monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated and emailed to the National Program (FBI) for
inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United States. 		
During 2007, the UCR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with IBR training 	
issues, interpretation of error reports, and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting
procedures, as well as assisted computer software vendors with reporting issues. 	There
are 18 private IBR certified vendors with software that transforms agency crime data into
an approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their own in-house
software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly reports are now posted on the IBR Web site 	
rather than having to be mailed to each contributing agency. 	The UCR office responded
daily to multiple requests for crime statistics from state agencies, government officials, 	
students, media, and the general public. 		
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter, the annual report, Crime in 	
Virginia, and distributed to contributing agencies. 	Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges, 	
legislators, and other state agencies are also informed of the availability of this 	
information. 	In 2004, the annual report was published for the first time on a CD rather 	
than hardcopy. 	Beginning in 2007, the annual report will only be available through the 	
State Police Web site. 	This report contains reported Group A offenses by each 	
contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B arrests by counties and cities in
Virginia. 	The data is used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and 	
legislative implementation. 		
The IBR contributing agency Website went into production in 2002. 	Currently there are 	
280 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through the Internet. 	This
Web site provides law enforcement agencies with the convenience of on-line monthly 	
data submission, receiving timely error notifications, monthly and year-to-date statistical 	
reports, performing searches and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals, bulletins, and 	
posting inquiries in the FAQ section.

During 2007, there were two law enforcement officers in Virginia who died while 	
performing their duties which are a decrease of eight from 2006. 	The 2007 offenses and
arrest data will not be available until approximately the middle of April. 	Through IBR
Grant funding, the front-end of the IBR Web site has been changed to allow agencies to
submit monthly files for editing so they may correct rejected incidents before sending data
to Virginia’s IBR central repository. 	Reformatting of IBR manuals and development of
online training modules are currently under development. 	The Department will seek
additional funding to complete additional phases of the improvement project. 	
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) 	
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 693 member agencies with 10,486 terminals, an
increase of 1930 terminals or 8% over the number of terminals in 2007. 	Of these
terminals, there were 3,029 non-mobile terminals. 	This number has remained stable over
the past year. 	Mobile terminals have increased to 7,457 (an increase of 7% from 2007).
In 2007, VCIN processed approximately 387,000,000 transactions (an increase of 7% of
the 2006 totals) between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state computer databases.
This system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three seconds.
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which
is critical to law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information
relating to wanted persons, missing persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently
retains Virginia information relating to 50,026 wanted persons (less than 1% increase as
compared to 2006), 845 missing persons, and 12,562 stolen vehicles. 	Agencies entered
12,562 Emergency Protective Orders, 1,715 Preliminary Orders, and 359 Orders of
Protection in 2007. 	
In February of 2008, the new VCIN Wanted “Hotfiles” System was implemented. 	Some of
the advantages of the new files are allowing agencies with access to a query page that
has the look and feel of a web page through Messenger. 	The query page will allow each
VCIN user to view a current list of his/her agency’s outstanding warrants, missing
persons, protective orders, felony/stolen vehicles/license plates/parts, and 	
towed/abandoned vehicles. 	The new file will also enhance VCIN Protective Order
transactions to be more compatible with NCIC. 	
Law enforcement agencies were given the opportunity to acquire one free two year
license of the new OpenFox Messenger software as part of the VCIN Image Project
Grant. 	The project is designed to enable law enforcement agencies to use the application
to receive and send images through an existing Virginia Criminal Information Network
(VCIN) terminal. 	As of February 19, 2008, 293 law enforcement agencies have accepted
and installed the new OpenFox Messenger program. 	
Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse 	
Virginia Amber Alert System 	
	13
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 20 of 53”
Table: 19
A new system was developed in March 2006 to automate the entry and notification 	
process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 	The system is designed to provide a 	
comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the safe recovery of a
child and capture of the abductor. 	Local law enforcement agencies can log into the 	
secure Virginia Amber Alert request form, enter the information and submit it 	
electronically to Virginia State Police. 	The system has significantly reduced the time 	
required to get this information out to the public. 		
In 2007, more than 500 law enforcement agency personnel were trained on the use of the
new system and agency personnel were educated about related revisions to the Code of
Virginia. 	The Clearinghouse is also working the Virginia Advertising industry to have 	
Amber Alerts posted on electronic billboards. 	Additionally, our agency created the 	
Endangered Missing Child Media Alert in 2007, to create a new alternative process 	
designed for use if a child goes missing and the incident may not meet all the criteria for
the AMBER Alert. 		
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse has also joined efforts with the
U.S. Department of Justice to educate Virginia’s fifth grade students about safety issues
through a national poster contest with a theme of “Bring Our Missing Children Home.” 	A
single winner from Virginia will be recognized and have their entry submitted for a national
judging competition by the Department of Justice. 	If they win the national competition, the
artwork will become the theme for all DOJ Missing Children publications in 2009. 	
Virginia Senior Alert Program 		
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia Assembly created the Virginia Senior 	
Alert Program. 	This program, managed by the Criminal Justice Information Service 	
Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police to publicize an incident of a 	
missing senior adult. 	When activated, the information will be publicized at 	
www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our media partners. 	In 2007, we activated
the system on three occasions. 		
Definitions for the program are: 		
Missing senior adult: 	an adult whose whereabouts are unknown and who is over 60 	
years of age and suffers a cognitive impairment to the extent that he is unable to provide
care to himself without assistance from a caregiver, including a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
Disease or dementia, and whose disappearance poses a credible threat as determined by
a law-enforcement agency to the health and safety of the adult and under such other 	
circumstances as deemed appropriate by the Virginia State Police. 	
Senior alert: 	the notice of a missing senior adult provided to the public by the media or 	
other methods under a Senior Alert Agreement. 		
Statutory Authority:

3. Whose disappearance poses a credible threat as determined by a law- 	
enforcement agency to the health and safety of the adult and under such other 	
circumstances as deemed appropriate by the Virginia State Police. 	
4. A law enforcement investigation has taken place that verified the senior adult is
missing and eliminated alternative explanations by a thorough search of the 	
immediate area if vehicular travel is not involved as a mode of travel for the adult.
5. Sufficient information regarding the missing senior adult is available to 	
disseminate to the public that could assist in locating the missing senior adult or
their vehicle. 									
6. The missing senior adult must be entered into the Virginia Criminal Information
Network (VCIN), the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) missing person files
and information reported to the Virginia Missing Person Information Clearinghouse
in the prescribed format. 								
7. 	A photograph of the missing senior adult must be provided to the Virginia 	
Missing Person Information Clearinghouse on the prescribed forms or agency 	
equivalent. 									
If all of the aforementioned criteria are not met, the Virginia “Senior Alert” Plan will
not be activated however information can still be provided to the media. 	
Information Technology Division 					
The Information Technology Division (IT) provides the computer infrastructure 	
in support of Virginia State Police's public safety mission and services to the 	
citizens of the Commonwealth. 	The IT Division is responsible for many mission 	
critical 	systems 	and 	applications 	which 	support 	local, 	state, 	and 	federal 	law
enforcement efforts. 								
Automated Fingerprint Processing 						
In 2007, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 395 systems in 264 local law 	
enforcement and civil applicant agencies. 	More than 262,000 arrest fingerprints were 	
electronically transmitted to State Police in 2007 from local law enforcement agencies. 	
This represents 92% of the arrest volume in Virginia. 	Approximately 90% of the arrests
received electronically at State Police were processed without manual intervention. 	
In 2007, almost 171,900 applicant prints were processed through the automated applicant
system, which reduces the turnaround time from months to days. Seventy percent of 	
these applicant requests were initiated at Live Scan devices and were processed with 	
minimal manual intervention. 								
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 			
										16
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 23 of 53”
Table: 22
The VCIN system processed over 387 million transactions in 2007, which is an increase
of 62 million compared to 2006. 	In addition, two new VCIN servers were installed
upgrading each server to 4 processors and 8GB memory. 	OpenFoxTM Messenger was
installed on 171 VCIN stations statewide as part of the NISP (Nlets Interstate Sharing of
Photos) photo project to provide DMV photos to every Virginia law enforcement agency.
Firearms System VCheck (Virginia’s Instant Background Check)
In 2007, 496 firearms dealers used VSP’s VCheck automated instant background check
system. 	Two thirds of firearms transactions are being processed directly by dealers using
this system. 	
In 2007, the functionality to provide information to dealers via the VCheck Home page
was added; thus eliminating mass E-mailings. 	
Sex Offender Registry (SOR) 	
The Sex Offender System was enhanced in 2007 to interface with DMV to track offender
residential addresses. DMV transaction data is tracked to check if offenders register the
change of their residential address with SOR registry within 72 hours of the change as
mandated by legislation. 	
The Higher Education interface was completed and provides a secure website for Virginia
higher education institutions to report student data to VSP as required by legislation. The
system checks this data against Virginia and NCIC sex offender data.
During 2007, VSP processed 15,746 and DOC processed 8,626 sex offender
verifications. 	
Palm Print System 	
The Palm Print system was implemented on November 12, 2007. The Palm Print storage
and search capability was developed as an additional component of Virginia’s statewide
AFIS system. 	Changes were made to receive the Palm Prints electronically along with
criminal arrest records and store them in a centralized database. 	Once stored, the Palm
Prints are available for crime scene (latent) fingerprint searches. 	
Approximately 1,800 sets of palm prints stored in the Archive system were converted to
the Palm System. 	Additionally, law enforcement agencies with AFIS terminals have the
ability to scan and store palm prints into the Palm repository. 	
Personnel Division 	
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource
management, with continued emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying
the Department’s work force. 	
Recruitment Unit 	
	17
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 24 of 53”
Table: 23
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in December 2006 to include a first sergeant, 	
sergeant/recruiter, six full-time recruiters and one part-time secretary. 	Refocusing
recruitment efforts has enabled the Department to concentrate on recruiting and hiring the
most qualified, diverse workforce to meet the demand of the future of policing in our 	
global communities. 	Specific recruitment strategies were designed and implemented to
aid in accomplishing the goals of the unit. 	
In 2007, the Recruitment Unit recruiters gave a combined 756 programs at selected sites
to generate a diverse and qualified applicant pool. 	The following are current strategies:
Recruitment “Lunch Boxes” – These programs are directed at Virginia’s universities,
colleges, and community colleges during the spring and fall semesters. 	Recruiters set up
in student unions, dining halls, etc., to introduce students to career opportunities within 	
the Department. 	These programs also foster a positive image between the student
citizens and policing. 	Recruiters conduct three programs per month in their division. (252)
Civic/Women/Minority Organizations – Organizations were identified in each of the 	
Department’s seven field divisions. 	Each recruiter is required to present three of these
programs with one of the three programs directed at women’s recruitment. (252) 	
Military Recruitment – Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning
military personnel. (84) 	Virginia has the most military facilities of any state in the nation,
and the military offers a very diverse candidate pool. 	
Student Athlete Recruitment – A minimum of two programs per month, during active 	
semesters, at identified college and/or university athlete populations via athletic unions
and organizations. (168) 	In addition, recruiters have identified health clubs and are
actively recruiting personnel who attend these facilities. 	One of the two programs per
month must be focused on women’s recruitment. 	
Job/Career Fairs – Job/Career Fairs (43) were conducted at various locations in and out
of state to include contiguous jurisdictions. 	These fairs are attended on a selective basis.
Public Safety Days/Career Sessions – Public Safety Days/Career Sessions are 	
scheduled and attended quarterly throughout the state to present to the public members
of the Department and information for those interested in joining. 	The focus of these
events is on the recruitment of minorities and women. 	
Employment Section 	
The Department hired 71 trooper trainees for the 113th Basic Session that began on 	
February 25, 2007, and 72 trooper trainees for the 114th Basic Session that began on 	
October 25, 2007. 	These troopers’ applications were processed from a pool of 1,198
applications received. 	The applicants for these schools took the Law Enforcement
Services, Inc., battery of written tests and on-line personal history questionnaire. 	
	18
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 25 of 53”
Table: 24
The Employment Section advertised 382 civilian positions (220 full-time and 162 wage) 	
throughout 2007. 	This is a 6.3% increase in the 358 positions advertised in 2006. 	The
total number of applicants who applied in 2007 was 3,895 (2,856 full-time and 1,039 	
wage). 	This is a 1.7% decrease in the 3,965 applications received during 2006. 	
The Employment Section processed 30 grievances during 2007, an increase of three 	
from 2006. 	There were 59 written notices processed, a decrease of 18.6% from the 70 	
written notices processed in 2006. 	Two equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints
were filed in 2007 (1 federal and 1 state), compared to 7 (6 federal and 1 state) filed in 	
2006. 		
During 2007, 65 volunteers gave 6,700 hours of their time in locations throughout the 	
state. 	This is a decrease of 13 volunteers and approximately 1,500 volunteer hours of 	
service from 2006. 	In April, a volunteer recognition event was held to thank our devoted
volunteers for their service to the Department in 2006. 		
The Employment Unit continues to provide training to Department supervisors and 	
employees on Workplace Harassment, Workplace Violence, and Grievance Procedures.
All new employees receive a comprehensive orientation, which provides a broad overview
of the operation of the Virginia State Police, the procedures, and policies that guide the 	
agency including performance expectations, compensation, and benefits. 	Education and
training to all employees continues to prove very successful. There were no complaints of
workplace harassment or workplace violence in 2007. 		
Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section (CCTR) 	
During the 2007 year, the CCTR section processed 184 original appointments of new 	
employees and 28 rehires placing them on payroll, processed 101 promotions, 333 	
transfers, 84 separations, 62 retirements, 17 demotions, 110 Special Rate changes, 125
short-term disability actions, 12 long-term disability actions, and a large number of 	
address and name changes. 	During this period, the section also received and processed
a large number of employment history and verification requests, 38 subpoenas, 1 FOIA 	
request, 120 requests for purchase of individual firearms, 105 outside employment 	
requests, and several legal inquiries. 	Additionally, 203 inactive personnel files will be 	
pulled from our inactive shelves, prepared and microfilmed. 		
The CCTR section also received, audited and processed 3 classification requests from 	
the Superintendent’s Office, 47 from BASS which included 20 from CJIS, 7 from 	Finance,
5 from Property and Logistics, 6 from Information Technology, 2 from Personnel, 6 from
Communications, and 1 from Training, 19 from BCI, and 19 from BFO. 	This section also
received and processed 1 in-band adjustment from BCI. 	In this period, reorganizations 	
occurred separating Property and Logistics from Finance. 	In addition, the Office of 	
Performance Management and Internal Controls was created from the Planning Staff 	
which were removed from the Information Technology Division. 		
In this period, this section also established or reallocated 16 wage positions and 	
responded to 8 salary surveys. 	CCTR also maintained all weight control records on all 	
sworn personnel, central Personnel Records, all Background Records, all Position Files 	
		19

Table: 25
and selected medical files for the Department. 	Additionally, this section reviewed and
processed all VEC inquiries, processed employees entering and returning from military
service, and analyzed and returned explanations for audit exceptions reports concerning
all pay transactions. 		
This section reviewed and processed 2,567 Performance Evaluations for 2007, which
included 993 rated as extraordinary contributor, 956 major contributor, 610 contributors, 5

In addition to its property and logistics duties, the Division oversees the mailroom
and printing sections, which processed 315,230 pieces of mail during 2007, and
printed 4,579,688 copies. 	It also manages the garage, which is responsible for
equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately 2,500 vehicles.
The Property and Logistics Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess
Military Property Program, which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to
procure, at no cost, military property and equipment that is in excess of the
Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as
the point of contact, and provides a state coordinator. 	The program serves over
250 Virginia law enforcement agencies and in 2007 the program distributed goods
valued over $725,000 dollars. 		
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-
day operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement
Program, “The 1122 Program.” 	This program allows state and local law
enforcement agencies to purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for
counter-narcotic activities through the federal procurement channels at substantial
savings. 	During 2007, over $940,952 	was purchased through this program,
saving the Department $325,191. 		
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS)
The Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program was originally conceived in the
mid-1990s to be an upgrade to the Virginia State Police's antiquated 1977 land mobile
radio system. 	As planning progressed, both technological advances and direction from
state government led the program to the present concept of a shared system composed
of the 21 state agencies that use two-way radio communication as a regular part of their
operations. 		
On July 13, 2005, Colonel W. Steven Flaherty, State Police Superintendent, and Mr. Mark
Moon, Vice President and General Manager of Motorola, signed a $329 million contract
between Motorola and the Commonwealth of Virginia for the design, construction, and
implementation of STARS. 	A ceremonial contract signing was held on July 16, 2005, in
conjunction with a press conference. 	The implementation of STARS is now underway.
To support the large increase of user agencies and radios, the microwave backbone of
the system is undergoing a complete renovation. 	The 87 existing tower sites will grow to
94 sites and the network is now designed to have alternate paths, or loops, to provide
continuously high reliability in the event of path outage.
There are 48 of these tower sites that will be used for the actual two-way communications
with the user's mobile and portable radios. From these sites, the Commonwealth
personnel will receive quality, statewide, mobile radio coverage. STARS will be one of the
		21
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 28 of 53”
Table: 27
first geographically statewide systems to employ digital trunked technology in the VHF
150 MHz band. 				
Virginia will be one of the first states to employ an Integrated Voice and Data (IV&D) land
mobile radio architecture, which uses the same mobile radio for both voice and law 	
enforcement computer communications. 	Virginia will, therefore, have statewide mobile
data coverage. Integrating the voice and data networks saves the Commonwealth the
expense of a separate data infrastructure. The IV&D infrastructure will also provide Over-
the-Air Re-Keying (OTAR) of the radio encryption, a recent technological innovation. 	This
allows the encryption codes resident in the vehicle’s equipment to be managed remotely.
The digital trunking technology allows different functional groupings of people to 	
communicate privately within their own organizational elements, known as “talk-groups,”
even while other groups are communicating among themselves. 	As the members move
throughout Virginia, the system will automatically track them so they will retain 	
communications statewide. 	
The digital trunking technology will also be carried a step further for the agencies that use
portable radios while away from their vehicles. STARS will include a Digital-Vehicular-
Repeater-System (DVRS), which will translate the VHF signal used between the tower
and vehicle, into a 700 MHz signal used for vehicle-to-portable communications. 	
STARS is complete in the Richmond area, which includes four cities and 21 counties. In
Tidewater, the Communications Center has been renovated with eight new dispatch 	
consoles. 	Testing of the tower sites began March 5, 2007 with anticipated completion of
the Tidewater area by September 2007. 	
During calendar year 2007, 95% of the construction has been completed on the new 	
Zone II Master Site for STARS at the Division VI Headquarters (Salem). Infrastructure
work is ongoing in Culpeper, Northern Virginia, Salem, Wytheville, and Appomattox. 	
The STARS Project is scheduled to be implemented over a six-year period.

A single interface link will be provided to each of the counties and independent cities to 	
bring interoperability at no cost to the jurisdiction. In a wide scale emergency, localities 	
may be connected to each other in this manner, thus providing regional 			
intercommunications. 	A $1.5 million dollar grant was received to implement an 		
interoperability solution named COMLINC within 14 counties in Central Virginia. 		
COMLINC is now operational in those 14 counties. 	Grant funding is being sought to 	
implement COMLINC statewide. 	If successful this will replace the single interface link to
each city and county. 											
The implementation of each of these exciting and cutting-edge technologies into STARS
will provide the Commonwealth with critical public safety communications. 		
The following Commonwealth of Virginia agencies and other organizations are

Table: 30
Juries may request the Department to investigate matters, which 	
constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts 	
investigations of elected officials when directed by the Governor, 	
Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau consists of the 	
Criminal Intelligence Division, Support Services Division, Drug 	
Enforcement Section, and the General Investigation Section. 	
General Investigation Section (GIS) 	
GIS responds to all complaints referred by the Governor and other complaints that 	
constitutes a Class 1, 2 or 3 felony. Other requests for investigations are discretionary but
major emphasis is placed on responding to requests from the Attorney General, 	
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Grand Juries, Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs throughout the 	
Commonwealth. 	
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement 	
agencies. Personnel are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state
to ensure that adequate response can be made to any location in a reasonable time. 	
During 2007, GIS conducted 3,646 investigations, of which 1,779, or 48%, resulted from
requests from other law enforcement agencies. GIS Special Agents made a total of 2,583
arrests. 	
Crime Scene Examination – The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by
the Division of Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called upon by other State
Police employees and by local law enforcement agencies to examine and evaluate 	
evidence at crime scenes. 	In 2007, 183 scenes were examined in cases of murder, rape,
robbery, burglary, and numerous other major crimes. 	
Fugitive Apprehension – The Fugitive Apprehension mission is to affect the swift 	
apprehension of all fugitives, particularly in connection with violent crimes. Agents 	
assigned to Fugitive Apprehension work closely with local and federal law enforcement 	
agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2007, members were assigned 478 cases and 	
made 994 arrests. 	
National White-Collar Crime Center – The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Criminal 	
Investigation is the Department’s representative to the National White-Collar Crime 	
Center, a federally-funded program with 2,527 member agencies and 247 associate 	
member agencies throughout the country. 	Members of the center assist with the
investigation and prosecution of various white-collar crimes. 	
Polygraph – During 2007, State Police polygraph examiners conducted 664 criminal 	
polygraphs and 437 administrative/pre-employment polygraph examinations.

included 233 requests from other agencies. 	A total of 194 arrests were recorded for the
year. 	These crimes included homicide, rape, robbery and sex crimes. 	
The Violent Crimes Investigative Unit conducted 38 case profiles for the year for the 	
Department and for other federal and local law enforcement agencies. The unit also 	
presented 46 training programs relating to homicides, sex crimes and hostage 	
negotiations. 		
Crisis Negotiators – During 2007, these specialty agents responded to 31 barricaded 	
subject situations. 		
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – The Cyber Crime Unit opened 147 cases in 2007, 	
involving a variety of investigations for this Department and other local and federal 	
agencies. 		
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant, who is assigned to the Support Services Division, is
the chief arson investigator and coordinates activities between the Bureau of Criminal 	
Investigation and other investigative agencies throughout the state. 	
Arson investigation training and assistance are provided when requested by localities. 	
During 2007, the chief arson investigator provided or assisted in providing the following 	
training related to arson investigations and explosives related matters: 	
	. 	Investigators attend a weeklong Arson Investigation School from statewide law 	
		enforcement, fire services and insurance agencies. 	
	. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling bomb 	
		threats, bomb scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices. 	
	. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and blast 	
		characteristics for law enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, 	
		conferences, and academies. 	
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically 	
trained to investigate arson-related matters. 	In 2007, GIS conducted 379 fire scene
investigations. 	Of these investigations, 93 were determined to be incendiary in origin, 103
were determined to be accidental, and 132 were of an undetermined origin. 	
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 32 trained bomb technicians 	
assigned to the GIS. 	In 2007, there were 331 explosives-related incidents requiring the 	
GIS to respond and provide explosives-related expertise. 	During 2007 there were 171
hoax and suspicious items requiring examination by bomb technicians. 	
Bomb technicians continue to present bomb threat presentations to school staffs 	
throughout the Commonwealth.

Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents are funded by
the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program. 	These Special Agents work closely
with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance Crimes Bureau,
and federal and local law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes related to auto theft
rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other illegal activity. 	
In 2007, the Special Agents conducted 135 motor vehicle theft investigations, resulting in
37 arrests and the recovery of 68 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment with a
combined value of $558,801. They also conducted 110 vehicle ID verifications for other
federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. 	
Auto Theft Agents coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft 	
investigators and insurance company special investigative units across the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These meetings are held to discuss current automobile theft
trends and coordinate enforcement efforts among law enforcement agencies. 	In addition,
members of the unit provide auto theft investigation training to numerous Troopers and
local law-enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police Academy and regional
academies. 	
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.)
Program is an insurance industry-funded program established by Section 38.2-414 of the
Code of Virginia. 	The Program was established in 1992 to receive and reward auto theft
related tips. 	Callers who provide information that leads to the arrest of individuals for auto
theft related crimes become eligible for cash rewards. 	On January 1, 2004 the maximum
reward increased from $10,000 to $25,000. 	Seven full $10,000 rewards were paid to
callers before this increase took effect. 	During 2007, one citizen was awarded the
$10,000 H.E.A.T. reward by helping the police. 	
The Department’s H.E.A.T. Program provides leadership to over 175 state and local
police and sheriff agencies working cooperatively to reduce auto theft throughout Virginia.
H.E.A.T. personnel support auto theft reduction efforts by providing training, conducting
promotional events, conducting prevention/VIN Etching events, offering grant funding,
procuring specialized equipment, coordinating monthly meetings of regional auto theft
investigators, providing Department of Motor Vehicles’ documentation to support
prosecutions and by assembling auto theft statistical information. 	Since 2003, over 454
title searches were completed for auto theft investigators in the United States and
Canada. 	
H.E.A.T. conducts two basic and one advanced auto theft investigation school for law
enforcement annually. 	H.E.A.T. and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association
cooperatively present auto theft prevention instruction to crime prevention specialists and
Operation HEATWave Coordinators 4 to 5 times per year. To enhance Virginia’s auto
theft investigative abilities, the H.E.A.T. office provides training scholarships totaling
$25,000 each year to send auto theft investigators from local law enforcement agencies
to receive specialized training conducted by the International Association of Auto Theft
Investigators. 	The H.E.A.T. office also supported the production of five bait cars that will
	27
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 34 of 53”
Table: 33
be employed in high theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 	Mobile Data
Hunter vehicles have also been deployed throughout the state to locate stolen vehicles.
The H.E.A.T. Program works with Neathawk Dubuque and Packett, a private marketing
agency, to increase the public’s awareness about the problem of auto theft, auto theft 	
prevention devices and strategies, the H.E.A.T. Program, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800- 	
947-HEAT) and cash rewards of up to $25,000. 	Citizens are directed to the H.E.A.T.
Web Site at: www.heatreward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The
public is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they ever learn of any auto theft 	
related information. 	In addition, H.E.A.T. promotional messages run throughout Virginia
on television, radio, billboards, newspapers and on three NASCAR race cars. 	
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted in a 	
momentous reduction in Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s motor vehicle
theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately 30%. 	Working together
to protect cars by employing the “Layered Approach to Protection” and educating the 	
public regarding the toll-free hotline to increase tips has proven to be an effective strategy
to make Virginia a safer place to own and operate a motor vehicle. 	
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly
approved establishing an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Department of
State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigation. In 2003, the General Assembly lifted the
sunset clause making the Insurance Fraud Program a permanent unit of the Department.
The purposes of this Unit are threefold: 	
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the 	
	Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently
	being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent of such insurance
	fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal,
	state and local police, other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or 	
	Units, and any other person; 	
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud
	that, in its judgment, require further detailed investigation; and conduct the 	
	investigations. 	
Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging burglaries, 	
fraudulently reporting theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation injuries. The IFP is 	
constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving 	
claim funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on
society as represented by the total amount of claimed loss that was actually received by
individuals submitting suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2007, more than $3.4 	
		28
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 35 of 53”
Table: 34
million was actually collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud and the total 	
amount involved in suspicious claims that was attempted, but not collected, was $7 	
million. 	
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household 	
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for
the increased cost of goods and services. This Program is dedicated to reducing the 	
impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of Virginia. The hotline
for persons to call in with information about suspected insurance fraud receives frequent
activity. The toll-free telephone number is: 1-877- 62FRAUD. (1-877-623-7283) 	
In 2007, 1,685 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward program
has been established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for individuals having a Sharp
Eye and reporting information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of individuals 	
committing insurance fraud. IFP operates the reward program by use of the insurance 	
fraud hotline and through information obtained during investigations and provided by the
general public. A reward committee has been selected to make recommendations based
on written policy and procedures. Their recommendations are forwarded through 	
channels to the Superintendent for final approval. 	Since 2003, the Insurance Fraud
Program has paid out $46,250 in rewards to those individuals that have a “Sharp Eye” 	
and reported insurance fraud. 	
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of insurance fraud
to the general public, law enforcement, the insurance industry and media. 	A portion of the Web
site provides the insurance industry and the general public the capability to report incidents of 	
suspected insurance fraud directly to the Insurance Fraud Program on line. This service is 	
available through the Department’s Web site and www.stampoutfraud.com 	
The Special Agents assigned to investigate insurance fraud have a primary focus of 	
fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2- 	
178, obtaining money under false pretense, which was amended by the General 	
Assembly in 2006. 	The amended code establishes venue for prosecuting the crime of
obtaining money by false pretense. 	This means that for crimes committed after July 1,
2006, the person charged with obtaining money by false pretense can be tried in one of 	
two places – the jurisdiction in which the person lived when the crime was committed or in
the jurisdiction where the crime was actually committed. 	
During 2007, more than 1,687 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance 	
fraud were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and the 	
general public. There were 458 criminal investigations initiated by the Special Agents and
315 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. 	One-hundred-eighteen insurance
fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered restitution of $323,993 	
during 2007. 	
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 	
	29
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 36 of 53”
Table: 35
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse
laws. The Section remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’
efforts to enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional field offices also help in this
effort by supporting special operations initiated by other law enforcement entities.
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian
support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 	
• DES Regional Field Offices 	
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 	
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 	
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 	
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 	
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 	
In 2007, DES field offices participated in 2,162 investigations that yielded $11,256,860 in
seized narcotics, $1,848,689 in seized currency, and 870 persons arrested on 1,374
felony and misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 1,040 persons were arrested on 1,503
felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES assisted other agencies. 	Special
Agents also seized 34 vehicles and 118 weapons. 	
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – During 2007, DES participated in 35 federal, state
and local multi-jurisdictional task forces, encompassing 108 local jurisdictions. 	These
multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 4,140 investigations that accounted for
$9,298,680 in illicit drug seizures, $670,020 in seized U.S. currency, and 2,429 persons
arrested on 3,174 charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that
resulted in 810 persons arrested on 1,156 charges. 	These task forces also seized 55
vehicles and 294 weapons. 	
Marijuana Eradication Program – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the
cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the
potential for being a major cash crop. With DEA funding, the Department of State Police,
along with assistance from other state and local law enforcement agencies, and the
Virginia Army National Guard Reconnaissance Air Interdiction Detachment (RAID),
conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically-grown marijuana. 	In 2007, the
State Police and local law enforcement agencies found 8,272 plants in 302 outdoor plots.
There were also 3,809 marijuana plants eradicated in 53 indoor grows. 	Marijuana
eradication operations resulted in 304 arrests. 	Seizures included 261 weapons, vehicles,
and other personal property valued at $409,013. 	Considering the estimated yield of
consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not reaching the
streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $12 million. 	
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is
to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member agencies. 	The five
facets of the GIANT mission are: 	
	30
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 37 of 53”
Table: 36
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor 	
	and outdoor, with the eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the
	growers as a primary goal; 	
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to 	
	monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by 	
	locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 	
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the 	
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in 	
	communication among the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, 	
	and; 	
5. Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum 	
	extent possible. 	
GIANT performed 443 operations during 2007 that resulted in 297 arrests, and the 	
seizure of $12,743,658 worth of narcotics. 	GIANT also netted 258 weapons, 26 vehicles,
and $198,575 in U.S. currency. 	
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit 	
purposes continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion predates 	
the massive abuse of other drugs we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug
Diversion agents work with the DEA, the Department of Health Professions, and the 	
Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies to 	
eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes. 	
During 2007, Drug Diversion received 1,724 complaints of diversion activities throughout
the Commonwealth. 	In response to these complaints, 762 investigations were initiated.
A total of 447 persons were arrested on 765 charges. 	Additionally, 17 search warrants
were executed during the past year. 	
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement officials 	
about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can
do about it. 	This role also included educating health care professionals, both physicians
and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and the importance of self-policing
and ensuring the integrity of their individual health care delivery systems. 	During 2007,
three presentations were conducted for 225 healthcare professionals, and eight 	
presentations were conducted for 334 individuals in law enforcement. 	The Drug
Diversion Unit, with assistance from the Department of Health Professions and the 	
National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (N.A.D.D.I.), hosted the Seventh 	
Annual Drug Diversion School in Roanoke, Virginia.

Criminal Intelligence Division 		
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document,
and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime or
terrorism. 	CID is currently composed of five units and one section – the Analytical Unit,
Research Unit, Field Intelligence Unit, Technical Support Unit, Computer Evidence 	
Recovery Unit, Tactical Intelligence Processing System (TIPS) Section, and the Virginia
Fusion Center. 		
CID’s Analytical Unit operates the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), which is a
repository of intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law enforcement 	
personnel. VCIC’s analysts provide research and analytical support to criminal justice
agencies. The analysts assigned use multiple databases and are in daily contact with
local, state, and federal organizations in order to accomplish their mission. 		
The Research Unit accomplishes a wide variety of tasks. 	They assist the other CID units
with specific research tasks, field investigations including surveillance, officer safety
issues, the handling of fictitious identifications for undercover personnel and serves as the
Department’s primary INTERPOL liaison. 	INTERPOL has now established a secure VPN
connection with the Department. 	This connection has simplified and expedited the 	
communication process with INTERPOL. 		
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect
and supply intelligence, including information on current investigations. 	The unit also
uses the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The unit is active in each of
the Department’s seven field divisions. 		
In 2007, the Department partnered with Washington-Baltimore HIDTA to participate in the
GangNet Intelligence System initiative. 	This multi-state regional system is currently being
populated with gang related information by law enforcement agencies in Maryland, 	
Washington, DC and Virginia. 	Additional states on the east coats are expected to join
GangNet in the near future. 	The Department has also provided training to a number of
our employees for data entry and user certification into the GangNet system. 		
In 2007, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) received 1513 requests for service. 	Of those
requests 430 were in support of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each
request was directly related to ongoing criminal investigations, which were supported by
the installation of audio and video recording equipment, Global Positioning System (GPS)
tracking equipment, covert surveillance and monitoring equipment, pen registers and
other technical support. 	The unit continues to support significant investigations and uses
methods and technologies to assist any requesting law enforcement agency. 	The unit
continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement agencies, as
well as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ offices through installation
		32

Table: 38
and operation of 73 closed circuit television systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	The
Hostage/Barricade Unit program continues to support state and local law enforcement 	
through the deployment of sophisticated technical equipment. The Hostage/Barricade 	
Unit responded to 22 Hostage/Barricade incident requests. 	The TSU received two 	
special purpose OP-V vehicles that provide satellite communications during a natural or 	
terrorist driven disaster. 	These vehicles were utilized on the scene of the Virginia Tech 	
shooting investigation. 		
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) provides assistance to local, state and 	
federal law enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for 	
computer-related evidence, evidence recovery through forensic examination, and 	
quarterly training classes in computer search and seizure. 	In 2007, the CERU completed
101 investigations on 278 computers, 773 other pieces of digital evidence and 18,285 	
gigabytes of data. 	The CERU also handled 1,529 internet fraud complaints and provided
345 hours of instruction on computer crime. 		
The TIPS Section has revised the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to provide for a
greater accounting of the current users of the system. 	This revision establishes a 	
requirement of user agencies to notify the Department when an individual user leaves 	
their department or no longer has a need to use the system. 	The section continues to 	
work with the 322 user agencies throughout the Commonwealth by providing training and
guidance in the use of the TIPS system. 	The TIPS Section also continues to work with 	
public safety agencies statewide to provide them with the Virginia Critical Information 	
Shared System (VCISS), a Terrorism Bulletin Board system that will allow intelligence to
be posted on a six-tiered system ranging from executive decision-makers, law 	
enforcement, critical infrastructure companies in both the private and public sector and 	
the general public. 	Application to access this system has been simplified by adding the 	
VCISS access request form t the Department’s website. 	DIC is currently working with the
Information Technology Division and VITA to develop a new Virginia Intelligence 	
Management System (VIMS) that will eventually replace TIPS. 	
The Virginia Fusion Center gathers, analyzes and disseminates information and 	
intelligence as it relates to all criminal activity, but primarily domestic and foreign 	
terrorism. 	In 2005, the Fusion Center moved into a new location within the Virginia 	
Combined Headquarters. 	This joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the
Virginia Department of Emergency Management is the first of its kind in the 	
Commonwealth. Its primary mission is to “fuse” together resources from local, state and 	
federal agencies and private industries to facilitate information collection, analysis and 	
sharing, in order to prevent or deter a terrorist attacks. 	Its secondary mission is to 	
support the Virginia Emergency Operations Center by centralizing information and 	
resources to provide a coordinated and effective response in the event of an attack or 	
natural disaster. 		
		33

Table: 39
CID is also responsible for the Terrorism Hotline, Drug Hotline, and the Domestic
Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The Terrorism Hotline has received 1000 calls
since its inception in 2001. The Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System was
established to assess vulnerabilities and threats related to terrorism in the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	
Support Services Division (SSD) 	
The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004 as a result of the 	
Department’s reorganization of BCI. The Insurance Fraud Division, Help Eliminate Auto
Theft (H.E.A.T.) and the Drug Diversion Unit were decentralized and absorbed within
SSD. 	Agents assigned to these units have continued their current investigative
assignments while operating out of the seven BCI field offices. 	
SSD is responsible for law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns and
insurance industry outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) and
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) units. 	The Arson/Bomb Program, the Drug Diversion
Program and the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) are also under the
SSD umbrella. 	SSD provides statistical gathering, technical training and financial
management support for these various units. 	The H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free
telephone hotlines are administered and maintained by the SSD. 	Initial notifications of
suspected insurance fraud and auto theft activities are received via the SSD hotlines,
Web sites, e-mails and faxes. 	The notifications are reviewed and distributed to the
appropriate local law enforcement agencies or to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s
field offices for investigation. 	
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 	
Since its establishment on July 1, 2000 by the Virginia General Assembly, the Special
Operations Division (SOD) has undergone a remarkable transformation. SOD’s original
mission was the interdiction of narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public transportation
systems, schools and businesses. 	SOD also provided assistance to local police
departments to address localized drug and firearm related problems/situations. 	
Following the events of September 11, 2001, the Special Operations Divisions was re-
designated as the Special Operations Unit, and expanded its personnel, offices and
duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit carried out the Virginia State
Police Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) Homeland Security responsibilities related to
response and recovery operations. 	The unit serves to coordinate the response of other
resources and serves as core members of the Statewide Regional Response Teams.
On January 10, 2003, the name of the unit was changed to the Counter-Terrorism &
Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) with fully operational teams in each of the seven traditional
State Police Divisions. 	On August 10, 2003, command of the unit was transferred to the
Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI), Support Services Division. 	
In November 2005, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new strategic initiative
developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes.

Homeland Security - The CCI Homeland Security component is prepared to respond to
a terror-related event to recover hazardous material evidence and assist other federal, 	
state, and local agencies. 	Many team members are certified Hazardous Material 	
Technicians trained to enter a scene that may be contaminated with biological, chemical,
or radiological substances. 	Each team is equipped with detection and monitoring 	
equipment to identify and classify hazardous substances employed during a terror attack
and collect samples for the purposes of determining treatment for persons exposed, and
obtaining evidence for prosecution. 	Some of the team members have completed 	
Environmental Crimes Investigation training provided by the Virginia Department of Fire 	
Programs. 						
Additional training is ongoing to further prepare the teams to deal with terrorist-related 	
bombings, suicide bombers, radiological attacks, and chemical nerve agent attacks. 	All
							35

team members are being trained to operate within the National Incident Management
Systems (NIMS) Incident Command System. 	The teams attend stakeholder meetings
and training with the local Hazardous Materials Teams and the Virginia Department of
Emergency Management (VDEM) Regional Hazardous Material Officers and the National
Guard’s 34th Civil Support Team. 	The teams also conduct training quarterly to maintain
certification utilizing assigned Personal Protective Equipment and Self Contained 	
Breathing Apparatus. 	
The unit has specialized response vehicles that are equipped with radiological detection
equipment, Multi-Rae Combustible Gas Indicator equipped with a photo ionization 	
detector to identify volatile and toxic gases, satellite television capabilities, weather 	
monitoring equipment, emergency decontamination station and a rehabilitation tent. 	The
unit also has Hazardous Material Identification Instruments that will allow field analysis of
liquids and powders. 	
The unit also has the ability to interdict and detect potential and/or developing threats
more quickly, with greater accuracy and through less intrusive means; thus reducing the
potential exposure to the citizens and the infrastructure of the Commonwealth. 	They
have biological detection instruments, instruments that monitor air quality over a large
area, and other safety equipment that will allow the Department to sustain hazardous
material operations in accordance with the federal guidelines. 	
BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 	
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over
64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. Uniformed
State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal law enforcement as
the need arises and based upon the ability of local law enforcement to respond. The 	
bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection Program
regarding the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations,
and the Aviation Unit that provides aerial support for law enforcement activities and 	
emergency medical evacuations. 	
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed
police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further subdivided into 48
State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or counties. Staffing is allocated
based upon workload demands at the city and county level. 	
Enforcement Initiatives to Address Highway Safety 	
Checkpoint Strikeforce 	
Identifying and removing drunk drivers from the highways of the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia is a primary objective of State Police 	
Troopers in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation. 	
	36
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 43 of 53”
Table: 42
Checkpoint Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that involves 	
saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on specific highways and in
locations where alcohol related incidents and arrests have been identified. This national
campaign is supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 	
and involves significant public education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement. 	
During 2007, a total of 18,900 vehicles passed through 54 DUI sobriety checkpoints 	
resulting in 76 drunk driving arrests. Additionally, DUI saturation patrols were conducted
on Interstates, primary and secondary highways throughout Virginia resulting in arrest 	
and the removal 590 alcohol impaired drivers. 				
Operation Air, Land, and Speed 				
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and 	
implemented an enforcement plan in 2006, to effectively reduce and eliminate vehicle 	
crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort was also intended to 	
combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving behavior on Interstates that pass
through Virginia to make travel in our Commonwealth safe and enjoyable for motorists. 	
With the success of this program, five enforcement phases were conducted in 2007:

During the five enforcement phases conducted throughout the year 2007, there were no
fatal crashes on the involved interstate highways where enforcement was increased and
visibility heightened.
Trooper Bowl
Trooper Bowl is a high visibility DUI enforcement initiative that has spread throughout the
Commonwealth. It kicked off following a successful initial program conducted on
Interstate 66 following the NFL Super Bowl - XL. The primary objective of Trooper Bowl is
to identify and arrest motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and jeopardizing
highway safety. The 2007, initiative resulted in 203 traffic arrests including 13 arrests for
driving under the influence of alcohol.
Click-it-or-Ticket
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the primary
functions of this national and statewide initiative. Virginia has seen a steady average
increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in 1997, to 79.9 % recorded
in 2007. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public awareness, education, and enforcement to
gain compliance with existing safety belt laws. Increasing the use of safety belts and child
safety seats have statistically shown to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting
from traffic crashes.
During the two phases of Click-it-or-Ticket in May and August, state police personnel
issued 2,553 summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 640 summonses for child
safety restraint violations.
Smooth Operator
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative intended, which aims to provide
education, information and solutions for the problem of aggressive driving. For nearly 10
years, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have partnered through the Smooth
Operator Program to combat aggressive driving. Law enforcement agencies, trauma
experts, government officials and other professionals have worked together to educate
motorists of the risks involved with aggressive driving, and to stigmatize aggressive
driving behavior on our roads.
Operation Cruise Control
Effective July 1, 2005, the State Police implemented “Operation Cruise Control” to
increase visibility and enforcement efforts to address all types of violations and the
reckless operations of a vehicle on Interstate 81 from our border with Tennessee to the
West Virginia state line.
During 2007, the operation was proven successful in controlling driver behavior and
preventing crashes and their destruction. Throughout 2007, troopers devoted 3,210
additional work hours to Interstate 81 and patrolled 54,115 miles resulting in
approximately 5,141 traffic summonses and 43 criminal arrests. From the traffic arrests
made, 2,998 were for speed violations and 599 arrests were made for reckless driving.

Operation C.A.R.E. 											
Proactive enforcement efforts and increased police visibility during the major holidays of
Memorial 	Day, 	Independence 	Day, 	Labor 	Day, 	and 		Thanksgiving 	are 	the 	primary
purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.). 				
During 	these 	major 	holiday 	periods 	that 	are 	noted 	for 	increased 	highway 	travel, 	the
Department 	maximizes 	the 	deployment 	of 	all 	available 		resources 	to 	address 	highway
safety and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth. 				
Highway Safety Corridors 										
There are currently 3 highway safety corridors in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Two are
on Interstate 95, one in Prince William County and the second in Henrico Country. The
other highway safety corridor is on Interstate 81 in Roanoke County. Highway safety 	
corridors were established as an additional measure to gain driver compliance to posted
speed limits and other applicable traffic laws. The corridor locations were determined 	
based on statistical crash data that identified specific sections of a highway to have a 	
higher than normal crash rate when compared to other segments of the same highway.
Establishing the Highway Safety Corridor allows the courts to impose higher penalties for
violations cited by police for traffic violations and criminal offenses. 				
A comprehensive review of highway traffic data indicates that within the highway safety
corridors traffic crashes are lower than in the previous year, and average vehicle speeds
and driver behavior was improved. Comparing first year data, enforcement statistics 	
indicated an increase in arrests for reckless driving arrests in the corridor, and a reduction
for speeding commercial vehicles in the safety corridor. Overall enforcement increased in
the corridors for the two year comparison. 								
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 							
During 2007, each of the department’s seven field divisions continued enforcement 	
emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within the counties in their 	
divisions. Each division’s program focused resources on those highways where crashes,
traffic violations, and citizen complaints regarding traffic were noted. The objectives of this
initiative were to prevent crashes, reduce violations, and address the concerns citizens
identified as threats to their safety. 									
Safety Division 											
As of December 31, 2007, there were 4,280 active inspection stations located throughout
the Commonwealth of Virginia. There were 14,528 licensed safety inspectors who 	
performed approximately 7,688,000 inspections at appointed stations during 2007. 	
Approximately 18% (1,387,100 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for inspection were 	
rejected for unsafe components. 									
This Division investigated 2,572 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,232 instances
of disciplinary action against 214 stations for various classes of offenses and the 	
suspension of 37 inspection stations. These statistics include administrative errors made
by inspection stations, and the majority of errors/ complaints were corrected by 		
counseling sessions.

Table: 46
Disciplinary action was also taken against 527 safety inspectors, resulting in 167 	
suspensions. 	
Safety Division personnel also conducted 1,374 business security checks. 	
Motor Carrier Safety 	
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety 	
requirements on Virginia highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety 	
program regularly present lectures to the public and other interested groups on motor 	
carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as instructors in 	
criminal justice training seminars. 	
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 60 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2006
and conducted 186 post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in 	
accidents. 	
Data indicates that during 2007, Troopers conducted 37,044 in-depth inspections on 	
heavy commercial vehicles and 8,591 of these, or 23 percent, were placed out of service
for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of hazardous
materials. 	
Field Support 	
The Safety Division’s sworn employees provided support for local field divisions during all
major C.A.R.E. holidays. During 2007, Safety Division troopers had 6,999 	
arrests/summonses issued, investigated 83 motor vehicle crashes, assisted local 	
Troopers with the investigation of 104 motor vehicle crashes, and assisted 2,580 disabled
motorists. 	
Aviation Unit 	
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the 	
administration and coordination of the department’s aviation resources. The Unit’s 	
primary mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical 	
evacuation. During its 24 year existence, the Aviation Unit has recorded 90,929 flight 	
hours responding to 61,696 flight requests. 	
The unit utilizes four bases located in the following Virginia localities: 	
	1) 	Lynchburg
	2) 	Manassas
	3) 	Abingdon
	4) 	Richmond
Aircraft 	
The unit operates seven helicopters and four airplanes across Virginia.

The BK117 and BO-105’s are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 	
Medical Evacuation 										
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve 	
Central and Southwest Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced 	
medical procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients to a level one trauma
center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the citizens residing in 59 	
counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to
calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began 	
operations on January 1, 1987 and responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of
Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began operations on September 1, 2000, and responds

Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 										
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary 		
responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that 		
utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. During 2007, approximately 18.9 million 		
commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for 		
inspection. Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement 		
initiatives, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 56,321 summonses and 		
made 162 criminal arrests. This program is vital to Virginia's overall highway safety 		
program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized vehicles; 		
through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the 	
highways; and through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they
are properly licensed to operate a commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 		
Crime Prevention 														
During 2007, the Department continued to provide specialized training to the Crime 		
Prevention Specialist troopers across the State on current crime prevention techniques.
Participating troopers received training in enhancing business and residential security 		
through the "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model. 		
Additional training focused on personal safety, workplace violence prevention and 		
personal information associated crimes. All training was part of an intensified crime 		
prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to achieve certification or remain certified 		
through the Department of Criminal Justice Services as Crime Prevention Specialist. 		
In calendar year 2007, approximately 182,000 citizens of Virginia were contacted through
3,045 various crime prevention and safety programs. These programs distributed nearly
38,000 informational handouts by certified crime prevention troopers. Troopers conducted
560 crime prevention programs and 878 Safety Programs. In addition 159 programs were
															43

Crime prevention troopers also conducted CPTED assessments on 1,019 businesses and
on 9 residences. Additionally, during 2007, troopers conducted 27 drug education 		
programs, 9 class action programs, and 9 Help eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) programs
to enhance safety in Virginia communities. 								
Below is a summary of significant crime prevention programs / activities for 2007: 		
• 	The 	Crime 	Prevention 	Program 	began 	certification 	of 	7 	new 	troopers 	to 	the
	program to account for promotions at the area office level. They should receive
	their certifications in mid-2008. 									
• 	The Virginia Judicial Security Initiative, which was initiated in 2005, has continued
	to require assets from the crime prevention program. These assets involved the
	participation 	in 	courthouse 	assessments, 	training 	and 	technical/subject 	mater
	expertise. The department’s crime prevention specialists, of which 27 are trained
	for 	this 	specialized 	form 	of 	assessment, 	have 	been 	directly 	involved 	in 	the
	assessment of 35 courthouses across Virginia. The program and its product have
	been recognized by several jurisdictions outside of Virginia and have adopted the
	program as their model. 											
• 	The 	Virginia 	Department 	of 	Aviation, 	in 	conjunction 	with 	the 	Department 	began
	addressing 	the 	security 	issues 	facing 	Virginia’s 	58 	General 	Aviation 	airports. 	In
	response, 	28 	crime 	prevention 	troopers 	received 	specific 	training 	needed 	to
	conduct 	comprehensive 	security 	assessments 	on 	these 	airports. 	In 	2007, 	the
	program 	provided 	independent 	assessments 	for 	21 	General 	Aviation 	airports
	across the state. These assessments are not only providing recommendations to
	the 	individual 	airports 	on 	methods 	to 	enhance 	security, 	but 	are 	gathering
	information which the Department of Aviation utilizes in projecting future security
	needs. 													
• 	The 	Department 	has 	continued 	to 	disseminate 	gun 	locks 	to 	the 	public 	and
	governmental agencies. During 2007, approximately 23,000 locks were distributed
	through public speaking events, county fairs, local public safety agencies, and the
	state fair of Virginia.
