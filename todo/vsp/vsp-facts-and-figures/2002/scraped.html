Communications Division 		
The Communications Division is responsible for the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of
telephone, land mobile radio, and microwave radios assigned to the Communications Division. Under the
command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates and maintains land mobile
radios, microwave radios and private telephone networks. The system includes 87 microwave radio sites, 46 of
which also have land mobile radio base stations. This responsibility includes compliance with requirements of
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 		
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible for: 	
• 	Maintaining mobile radios; 		
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios; 		
• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals; 		
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, obstruction lighting, antennas and emergency power
	plants; 		
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices; 	
• 	Installing and maintaining equipment, telephones, and other telecommunications at Administrative
	Headquarters; and 		
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for mobile and fixed communications equipment.
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. Of the 23 sites considered to be the
backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to digital service. High capacity digital service is
now available to all Division Headquarters locations except Division IV and VII. Site development continues to
provide digital service to Division VII. 	The Communications Division has procured the necessary microwave
equipment to provide access to Division IV. Additionally, site development is underway to provide digital
microwave service to sites on the Eastern Shore. 	Cooperative development or collocation agreements
continue to fund equipment upgrades from analog to digital microwave systems. Two new microwave sites are
being developed and six existing sites are being upgraded to accommodate digital systems. The total worth of
these collocation and relocation agreements has saved the Department approximately $8 million over the past
six years. Work in progress will save another $500,000. 	
Upgrades to sites continue, with the most recent improvements made to area offices at West Point, Danville,
Chesapeake, South Hill, and Suffolk. 	Buildings are being replaced or refurbished as necessary, with capacity
to support the new Shared Land Mobile Radio Network. 	
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Project team to define the
existing network and review plans for the new upgraded State Police Land Mobile Radio Network that will
serve all of the Commonwealth’s state level public safety agencies. 	
The Division has procured and installed almost 250 mobile computer terminals (MCTs) and wireless modems
to be used for messaging and routine checks of drivers’ licenses and vehicle registrations. Additionally, the
Communications Division has provided similar hardened laptop computers to Sergeants in areas, even where
wireless service is not available. 	The Communications Division completed installation of a new mobile flash
server, which will be able to provide upgrades to forms and software when needed. 	The Communications
Division has assisted with a pilot project to provide access to the Computer Aided Dispatch System for
troopers equipped with MCTs. 	Approximately 240 additional units are planned for installation in the coming
year. 	Deployment of these units will be continued in Divisions I, II, V and VII where public wireless data
services are currently available. Additionally, 16 troopers will soon be equipped with MCTs in the Salem and
Roanoke Areas by partnerships with the City of Roanoke to provide access to their private system. 	Upon
completion of the STARS Project, service will be provided to all areas. 	
All telephone systems at Administrative Headquarters and Division Headquarters have been upgraded, as well
as the telephone systems in many area offices.

The Division continues to provide communications support for special events as they occur. Such activities
include communications systems to support security for visiting dignitaries, National Drag Races in Dinwiddie
County, the State Fair of Virginia, the Fiddlers’ Convention, and Floyd Music Fest. The Communications
Division also provided a portable radio system for security on the roads near the Pentagon 	
All field Division radio shops are certified as independent laboratories by The Division of Consolidated
Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning forks. 	In the past year, approximately 200 additional
RADAR units were procured and issued to expand availability and replace older units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone and local area network wiring requirements for the Department, as
well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of equipment are being maintained
for six additional agencies. The Division also continues to maintain approximately 9,000 items of radio
equipment for most of the state’s public safety agencies. The Communications Division has actively 	
participated with the Capital Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and Public Safety Wireless Network
(PSWN) activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 	
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 	
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) will facilitate the communications of 20 participating state
agencies by upgrading the existing Virginia State Police land mobile and microwave radio networks. 	STARS
will create an integrated, seamless, statewide, wireless voice and data communications system designed to
meet the needs of these agencies. 	The system will be shared by agencies engaged in public safety, 	
protection, and service; and will facilitate interoperability with localities at the county and city level. 	
To accomplish this, the project will upgrade the technology and enhance coverage of the land mobile radio
network, upgrade the technology of, and create disaster recovery alternate paths for the microwave radio
network, create a secure statewide Intranet with wireless access and implement statewide law enforcement
mobile data. 	Radio communications for the Virginia components of the National Weather Service’s Integrated
Flood Observing and Warning System (IFLOWS) network are also being upgraded as part of this project.
Future procurement phases are expected to expand portable radio coverage where required, implement
wideband data, and extend Intranet access to the other participating agencies. 	Project completion for all three
procurement phases is scheduled for 2011. 	The STARS Project will provide participating agencies with a cost-
effective systems approach and enable interoperability between federal, local, and Commonwealth 	
government agencies. 		
Beginning in February of 2002, proposal responses from prospective offerors were received and an evaluation
process was begun. 	The lengthy evaluation process was nearing completion at the close of 2002. 	
Also during 2002, preparations for an evaluation test of proposed radio equipment were completed. 	This
effort involved everything from the procurement and installation of equipment at and around the VSP 	
Headquarters tower site, to installing vendor proposed radios in a test vehicle that was specially up fitted to
accommodate communications engineers, test equipment, and evaluation radios during a drive test. 	In
addition, five current model VSP patrol vehicles were equipped with the proposed radio equipment to provide
platforms for functional testing and equipment demonstrations. 	
Criminal Justice Information Services Division 	
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all files within the
Department. This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction and archiving of records in accordance
with the Records Retention Schedule. 	The Division also acts as the point-of-contact and liaison with the
Library of Virginia. 	The Division processed and responded to 1,439 subpoenas and 124 Freedom of 	
Information Act requests in 2002. 		
Central Criminal Records Exchange – The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed
35,230 investigative reports in 2002. 		
	4 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 5 of 25”
Table: 5
Staff of the Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) automated 4,624 non-computerized criminal records
in calendar year 2002, leaving a total of 158,837 misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated. 	
The Supreme Court/State Police disposition interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District
Courts and 124 Adult Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	In
2002, 334,402 records were transmitted, negating the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy
disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of all dispositions transmitted, 55,800 or 16.7% were rejected. 	In February 2000,
the arrest/disposition monitoring system was implemented. 	Designed to reduce human intervention, 	
notifications are automatically generated for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 	For 2002 notifications for 21,485
individual charges were generated. The majority of notifications (89%) were generated because the court
did/could not include the Document Control Number when transmitting their data. The remaining notifications
(11%) were generated when the court had transmitted the Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have
a corresponding fingerprint card on file. 			
The Non-criminal Justice Name-Search program continues to experience growth, with 352,758 inquiries
processed in 2002. 	The demand for the service has increased 296% in the past 10 years. 	The Non-criminal
Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented February 8, 1996, to effectively address the demand. 	The NCJI
eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process “paper record name-search requests.” 	As of
December 31, there were 147,960 electronic name-search transmissions received from participants, with an
average response time of 72-hours or less since implementation. 	NCJI is upgrading, effective March 18, 2002,
to access through the Department’s web site. 	This will tremendously enhance customer service. 	
The Mental Health File records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to
purchase a firearm(s). 	Official notifications of individuals in these categories are received from clerks of courts
upon court adjudication of an individual being incompetent, involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated.
As of December 31, 2002, there were 6,654 mental health records added, bringing the total records on file to
47,303. 			
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry – The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 11,636
fingerprint-based registrations received since July 1, 1998. 	The Registry is designed to protect the general
public, and children in particular, by providing personal descriptive and sentencing information on individuals
convicted of certain sex crimes. 	Photographs of offenders are available, and violent offender registrations are
maintained on the Internet. 	There were 88,546 searches conducted against the Registry for employment-
licensure purposes in 2002. 	During 2002, the SOR verified the address of 17,931 sex offenders, and initiated
2,129 `criminal investigations to the field divisions. 			
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) interface was developed to comply with Section 19.2-390, 	
Paragraph (E), of the Code of Virginia. 	Effective March 18, 2002, the Department began accepting 	
Correctional Status Information (CSI), however, the Department of Corrections (DOC) is not agreeable to
provide probationer statuses. 	This is not in compliance with the mutually agreed upon “General Design” or the
statutory requirement to report selected probationers statuses to CCRE. 	Additionally, the Department has
completed programming to accept CSI from DOC’s inmate and probationer databases. 	This issue is being
documented to the DOC Deputy Director. 	Conversely, the inmate commitment conversion is being 	
accomplished very smoothly with genuine support and cooperation. 		
The Microfilm Section staff archived 957,814 documents during 2002. 		
Photographic Laboratory –The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responded to requests for 	
photographs, digital images, and court enlargements. 	Additionally, 136,860 photographic prints were 	
developed for use by sworn personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal
cases. 			
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System 	(AFIS) 		
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System is a shared state and local computer system. 	The 	
Department and 22 state and local agencies have access to the system through terminals located in their
	5 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 6 of 25”
Table: 6
agencies. 	There are 1,474,713 fingerprint cards and 65,874 unsolved latents on the database. 	During 2002,
there were 1,064 suspects identified as a result of searches on the AFIS system. 		
The Department’s live scan network, installed in local agencies, electronically captures and transmits arrest
and fingerprint information to the State Police and FBI, where it is searched on AFIS as it is received. 	These
procedures detect aliases and outstanding warrants on 		
.arrested individuals before they are released. 	Live scan equipment is currently in production in seventy-nine
sites. 	It is anticipated that ten to twelve additional live scan sites will be installed in 2003. 		
During 2002, the fingerprint section processed 229,085 criminal, 99,000 applicant, and 2,417 sex offender
fingerprint cards. 			
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 			
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based on the results
of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2002, 187,959 firearm transactions were 	
conducted. 	Of these, 2,363 were disapproved, and 136 wanted persons were identified with 61 arrests 	
reported. 	Also in 2002, the State Police made 619 criminal arrests based on the illegal purchase, or attempted
purchase, of a firearm. 	Certificates for 322 multiple handgun purchases were issued authorizing the purchase
of more than one handgun within any 30-day period. 			
Direct Access 			
The Direct Access program has been tremendously successful with statistics indicating the current on-site
terminal dealers handled approximately 33% of the transactions processed through the Firearms Transaction
Center (FTC) during 2002. The FTC will continue to expand the Direct Access program via additional 	
participating dealer locations. 	As on-line users increase, staff is diverted from telephoned firearm transactions
to research and verification processes. 	Additional employee time devoted to these processes provides more
efficient overall services to the firearm dealers and gun buying public. 		
Legislation by the 2000 Virginia General Assembly requires a fingerprint-based criminal background check be
performed for employees of a gun dealer to transfer firearms, and requires the issuance of a Seller 	
Identification Number by the Department of State Police for qualified employees. 	In 2002, 864 seller 	
identification numbers were issued. 			
The FTC maintains 6,424 machine gun registrations. 	Additionally, the FTC maintains the Criminal Firearms
Clearinghouse, a central repository of information regarding all firearms seized, forfeited, found or otherwise
coming into the possession of any law enforcement officer that are believed to have been used in committing a
crime. 	In 2002, 5,497 reports were made to the Clearinghouse. 	Also, the State Police entered 28,560 	
concealed handgun permits into the Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN). 	Since July 1, 1995, a total
of 218,484 permits have been entered into VCIN. 			
Uniform Crime Reporting 			
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting
(IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different crime offenses.
During 2002, two agencies became certified for IBR submission, bringing the total IBR agencies to 270. 	These
agencies represent 97% of the total UCR contributing agencies, and 99% of the total population of Virginia.
The UCR office no longer accepts summary hard copy reports. 	Data is submitted by diskettes that are 	
scanned, copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	Approximately four times a month, this data is run through
the edit process, which generates an error report for the agencies to correct any incidents that failed to be sent
to the IBR central repository database. 	A monthly tape of Virginia’s data is generated and sent to the FBI for
inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United States. 		
During 2002, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues, interpretation of error
reports and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting procedures, as well as assisting vendors with
reporting issues. 	There are 19 private vendors representing IBR certified agencies. 	Several large agencies
have built their own in-house software systems. The first quarter agency data reports were mailed to each
contributing law enforcement agency. 	Since then the agencies have been able to retrieve their monthly and
	6 		
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 7 of 25”
Table: 7
quarterly reports from the IBR web site. 	The UCR office responded to approximately ten requests daily for
crime statistics. 		
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletters, and in the annual report Crime in Virginia, and
distributed to contributing agencies, commonwealth’s attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state agencies.
The annual report is available to the public for a nominal fee. The 2001 annual report, published in June 2002,
was the second publication containing only IBR data. The Crime in Virginia report can also be found on the
State Police web site. 	Staff members were diligent throughout the year informing the media and the public of
the new reporting system and advising them that comparisons to previous years should not be made.
The new IBR website began receiving IBR data via the Internet in 2002. 	This site provides law enforcement
agencies with the convenience of on-line monthly data submission, receiving timely error notifications and
monthly and year-to-date statistical reports, performing searches, viewing manuals and bulletins, and posting
inquiries in the FAQ section. 	During 2002, 165 agencies were set up for Internet submission.
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center (NCIC)
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 651 member agencies with 5,971 terminals. 	Of these, 2,572 terminals are
non-mobile, and 3,399 are mobile terminals. 	In 2002, VCIN processed in excess of 204,911,736 transactions
between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and state computer databases. 	This system processes messages
and/or transactions in approximately three seconds. 	
Virginia agencies have entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which is critical to
law enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information relating to wanted persons,
missing persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia information relating to 43,673
wanted persons, 964 missing persons, and 11,590 stolen vehicles. 	
During 2002, the Department completed the conversion to NCIC 2000. 	This conversion will permit VCIN
agencies the ability to enter and access more critical information within the NCIC systems.
Data Processing Division 		
The Data Processing Division operates one of the largest computer centers in state government.
Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment and software provided by IBM,
NEC Corporation, UNISYS Corporation and SUN Micro Systems. The Division operates two separate
computer rooms 24 hours a day. 		
Automated Fingerprint Processing 		
In 2002, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 85 systems in 69 local agencies. 	Eight of these systems are
installed in applicant agencies, the rest are in local booking stations. 	
More than 181,900 arrest fingerprints were electronically transmitted to State Police in 2002 from local
agencies. 	This represents 80 percent of the arrest volume in Virginia. Over 60 percent of the arrests received
electronically at State Police are processed without human intervention 	
In 2002, 98,929 applicant prints were processed through the new automated applicant system, which reduces
the turnaround time from months to days. 		
CAD/MIS 		
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid entry and retrieval of data
associated with unit activity and calls for service. The CAD system consists of 15 servers, 42 dispatch
terminals, and over 100 remote access users. A total of 1,189,846 incidents were entered into the CAD system
in 2002. A limited interface to the Virginia 511 Travel Shenandoah and the VDOT Northern Virginia Smart
Traffic Center was implemented in 2002. This interface provides real time access to traffic information in the
CAD system. An expanded interface between the VSP CAD system and VDOT systems is planned for 2003.
Over 100 programs were changed or created to allow for a greater interface between each of the department’s
CAD systems and to create the CAD/Mobile interface. Mobile software was customized to provide field users
	7 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 25”
Table: 8
with a wide range of functionality from their vehicles. The CAD/Mobile interface and the Mobile software will be
installed in 2003. 		
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) was placed into production in June.
This database currently has CAD information back to March1999. CAD historical data is transferred to MIS
nightly. The data base currently holds in excess of five million records. An Intranet web page allows VSP
network users to create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. The web page also allows
user access to weekly and monthly reports. The MIS database allows the Department to track and access
information never before available, such as average response times, total number of calls, and average 	
workloads. 		
Virtual Private Network (VPN) 		
In 2002, the Telecommunications Engineering section of the Division began replacing the Departments Internal
and External dedicated circuit networks with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This type of network connection
uses the Internet for agencies connecting to State Police and State Police Offices throughout the State. 	This
networking configuration is cost efficient and saves the State thousands of dollars in line cost. 	It is also secure
and the data crossing the connections is encrypted to 128 Bit encryption. The VPN network will continue to be
implemented into 2003. 	This will continue until all agencies communicating with the State Police, as well as all
State Police offices, are using the VPN network. 	It will support the Virginia Criminal Information Network
(VCIN), the Live Scan Fingerprint System, the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), and the
Tactical Intelligence Processing System. 		
Network Infrastructure 		
Also in 2002, the Telecommunications Engineering section of the division began planning a completely new
redundant switched infrastructure for the State Police network. 	This infrastructure was ordered and will be
installed during the second and third quarters of 2003. 	It will consist of NORTEL level three switches and
redundant pathing between switches and routers at State Police Headquarters. 	This will eliminate single
points of failure for the network and increase throughput for all process on the network. 	It will also provide the
network with multiple paths between switches and routers that will allow the network the ability to maintain up
time to a maximum. 	Once the full installation is complete, the State Police will be able to provide a stable and
high-speed network far into the future and better position it to provide future services that the ever-changing
law enforcement environment will require. 		
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 	
A new Virginia Criminal Information Network system was placed in December 2002. 	The new system, an IBM
model p610, satisfies the FBI security requirements for dissemination of information. 	For example, the VCIN
system will authenticate access by user name and password. 	New software within the VCIN application will
provide image transmission capability. 	The new system has the High Availability option, which will reduce
outages by automatically switching when a hardware failure occurs to a secondary system without interruption.
Personnel Division 		
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management, with continued
emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the work force. 	
Recruitment Unit 		
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in 2002 to include a first sergeant, three full-time trooper recruiters and
four part-time trooper recruiters. 	Refocusing recruitment efforts has enabled the Department to concentrate on
recruiting and hiring the most qualified, diverse workforce to meet the demands of the future of policing in our
global communities. 	Specific recruiting strategies were designed and implemented to aide in accomplishing
the goals of the unit. 	Fifty-three recruiting programs were presented during 2002 as a result of the following
recruitment strategies: 		
Civic/Minority/Women’s Organizations – Organizations were identified in each of the Department’s seven field
divisions. 	Each recruiter is required to present two programs per month to organizations within their division.
	8 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 9 of 25”
Table: 9
Recruiting “lunch boxes” – These programs were introduced during 2002 on college campuses in Virginia 	
during the fall and spring semesters. 	Recruiters set up in student unions, dining halls, etc. to introduce 	
students to career opportunities with the Department. 	This also fosters a positive image between the student
citizens and policing. 	Recruiters conduct three programs per month in their division. 		
Military Recruitment - Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning military personnel. 	
Career Fairs - Career fairs are conducted at various locations throughout the state as well as contiguous 	
jurisdictions. 			
Student Athlete Recruitment–A minimum of one program per month, during active semesters, at identified
college and or university student athlete populations via student athletic unions or organizations, are targeted.
Women in Law Enforcement Career Day – A Women in Law Enforcement Career Day was held in May at the
State Police Academy. 	This event featured women troopers and leaders in the department as we introduced
the public and particularly women to careers in law enforcement. 		
Applicant Work Performance Testing – The Recruitment Unit administered the Work Performance Test to 	
approximately 850 applicants in Phase I testing during 2002. 		
Employment Section 			
The Department hired 54 trooper trainees for the 102 nd Basic Session that began on February 25, 2002, and
56 trooper trainees for the 103 rd Basic Session, which began on April 10, 2002. These troopers’ applications
were processed from a pool of one thousand four hundred thirty seven applications received. 	
Beginning with the 104 th Basic Session, the Department began testing with a new consultant, Law 	
Enforcement Services, Inc., using their battery of written tests and on-line personal history questionnaire. 	The
Employment Section tested and the Department subsequently hired sixty-one Trooper trainees for the 104 th
Basic Session, which began on October 13, 2002. 	An applicant pool of one thousand eight hundred and sixty
eight applications was processed in order to hire trooper trainees for this school and a 2003 school.

Sheriffs’ Association and the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police to prepare “Racial Profiling in Virginia: An
Analysis of State and Local Law Enforcement Practices.” 	During this reporting period, staff assisted in the
development of eight grant applications. 	At the end of the year, the Unit was monitoring 17 grants that provide
approximately $13.5 million for agency projects The Unit was also responsible for the implementation and
management of the VSP Idea Line, which is an internal communications tool designed to provide an upward
and downward flow of information within the agency. 		
Accreditation 		
The purpose of the accreditation process is to improve the delivery of law enforcement services by
demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally accepted standards. Accreditation
requires a comprehensive review of every aspect of the Department’s organization, operations, and
administration. 		
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the nation to be
accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), Inc. 	In 1991, 1996,
and again in 2001, the Department achieved reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review by
CALEA assessors of the agency’s policies, procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an
on-going project for all accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic
updating of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement
accreditation standards. 		
Property and Finance Division 		
The Property and Finance Division encompasses a wide range of financial and property management
functions. 	It is responsible for preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the Department's annual operating
budget, which was in excess of $191,534,008 for fiscal year 2002. 	It was responsible for the procurement,
warehousing, and distribution of more than $20,160,829 in supplies and equipment last year. 	The Property
and Finance Division is also responsible for the management and maintenance of more than 110 buildings and
grounds across the State. 		
During fiscal year 2002, construction was completed on the new Area 43 office in Pittsylvania County and
renovations and additions to the Area 31 office in Melfa. 	Construction is scheduled to begin on facilities in
Clifton Forge, Staunton and an addition to the Administrative building in Richmond.

2,100 vehicles. 														
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military Property Program,
which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost, military property, and equipment that is
in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as the point of
contact, and provides as state coordinator. 	The program serves over 230 Virginia law enforcement agencies
and in 2002 the program distributed goods valued over $3.5 million dollars. 							
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day operational control of
the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122 Program”. 	This program allows state
and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic
activities through the federal procurement channels at substantial savings. 	During 2002, over $5,000,000 was
purchased through this program saving the Department $1.5 million.

			BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 				
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all criminal matters mandated by
statute and established Department policy through the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is 	
mandated to investigate any matter referred by the Governor. Additionally, the Attorney General, 		
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs and Grand Juries may request the Department to 	
investigate matters, which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of 	
elected officials when directed by the Governor, Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau consists of the
Divisions of Criminal Intelligence, Drug Enforcement, General Investigations and Insurance Fraud. 		
Criminal Intelligence Division 											
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document, and disseminate 	
criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime and terrorist groups. 	The CID is 	
composed of three units - the Research Unit, the Analytical Unit, which includes the Virginia Criminal 	
Intelligence Center (VCIC) and the Technical Support Unit. 								
The CID operates the VCIC, which is a repository of intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law
enforcement personnel. 	VCIC’s personnel provide research and analytical support to criminal justice 	
agencies. 	Two research agents and seven field intelligence agents interact with investigators and task forces
to collect and supply information on current investigations. 								
CID is also responsible for the Virginia Narcotic Pointer Index system, the Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT)
Hotline, the Drug Violation Hotline, the Insurance Fraud Hotline and the Terrorist Hotline. 	During 2002, VCIC
personnel processed 640 Hotline calls.

The Department participated in the Virginia Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Documentation
(VALID) and published a monthly intelligence bulletin, The VALIDATOR, which was disseminated throughout
the intelligence community. 		
Technical Support Unit 		
In 2002, the Technical Support Unit received 512 requests for service. 	Of those requests, 256 were in support
of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal
investigations, which were supported with the installation of audio and video recording equipment. 	The Unit
continues to support significant investigations and uses methods and technologies to assist any requesting law
enforcement agency. 			
The Unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement agencies, as well as
supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ offices through installation and operation of closed
circuit television systems for cases involving victims of child abuse. 	
The Hostage/Barricade Response program continues to support state and local law enforcement through the
deployment of sophisticated technical equipment. 	The Hostage/Barricade Response program responded to 6
Hostage/Barricade incident requests in 2002. 		
Department efforts have resulted in receipt of grant money that has benefited the Unit. 	Nearly 4 million dollars
has been directly targeted in support of the Unit’s initiatives. 	
Drug Enforcement Division (DED) 		
DED continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws. 	The Division
remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws.
DED’s mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support personnel in eight
distinct functional areas: 		
• 	DED Regional Field Offices 		
• 	Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 		
• 	Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 		
• 	Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 	
• 	G.I.A.N.T. Operations 		
• 	Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit 	
• 	Asset Forfeiture 		
DED Regional Field Offices - Seven DED Regional Field Offices perform operational narcotics enforcement
investigations, as well as support special operations (undercover, wire intercept, marijuana eradication),
initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 100 special agents available for enforcement and task
force duties at seven field offices. 		
From Jan. 1, 2002 through Dec. 31, 2002, the field offices participated in 1,400 investigations that yielded
$7,838,999 in seized narcotics, $542,371 in seized currency, and 275 persons arrested on 416 felony and
misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 428 persons were arrested on 572 felony and misdemeanor charges in
cases where DED assisted other agencies. 	DED also seized 24 vehicles and 116 weapons. 	
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DED participates in 25 state/local multi-jurisdictional task forces,
encompassing 93 local jurisdictions. 	Twenty-seven State Police special agents and 125 local officers were
assigned to state/local task forces. 		
During 2002, the multi-jurisdictional task forces participated in 3,275 investigations that accounted for
$21,504,575 in illicit drug seizures, $427,197 in seized U.S. currency, and 1,738 persons arrested on 2,471
		14

Table: 15
charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that resulted in 439 persons arrested on 575
charges. 	These task forces also seized 43 vehicles and 132 weapons. 	
Federal Task Forces – DED participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during 2002. 	Thirteen State
Police special agents, as well as officers from local police departments and agents from Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), were
assigned. 	The federal joint task forces conducted 61 investigations that accounted for $2,119,570 in drug
seizures, and 27 persons arrested on 121 charges. 	These task forces also assisted in 30 arrests on 95
charges. 	No vehicles and no weapons were seized. 		
Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the
cultivation of the marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for being a major
cash crop. 	With DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local
law enforcement agencies, conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically grown marijuana. 	The
State Police and local law enforcement agencies found 15,343 plants in 435 outdoor plots. 	There were also
2,545 marijuana plants eradicated in 31 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 257
arrests. 	Seizures included 121 weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at $381,687.50.
Considering the estimated yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not
reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $17.8 million. 	
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to facilitate and assure
coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Six special agents are assigned to GIANT. The five
facets of the GIANT mission are: 		
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and outdoor, with the
	eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers as a primary goal of GIANT;
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor suspicious
	activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying
	users; 		
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the Commonwealth by 	
	interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 	
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in communication among
	the various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and; 	
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum extent possible.
GIANT performed 519 operations during 2002 that resulted in 304 arrests, the seizure of $16.9 million worth of
narcotics, 61 weapons, and $133,163 in U.S. currency. 	
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit purposes
continues to be a severe problem in Virginia. 	In fact, drug diversion predates the massive abuse of other
drugs we know so well today. 	The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit works with the DEA, the Department of
Health Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies,
to eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs to illicit purposes. 	
During 2002, the Unit received 744 complaints of diversion activities throughout the Commonwealth. 	In
responses to these complaints, 399 investigations were initiated and the 13 special agents assigned to the Unit
arrested a total of 213 persons on 478 charges. 	Of the 213 persons arrested, 9 were licensed health care
professionals. 	Ten search warrants were executed during the past year. 	
A major educational role of the Unit is teaching local law enforcement officials about the extent of the drug
diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it. 	This role also included educating
health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and the
		15

agencies. 	In addition, members of the unit provide auto theft investigation training to numerous troopers and
local law-enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police Academy and regional academies throughout the
course of the year. 		
The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Program is an insurance industry-funded program established by
Section 38.2-414 of the Code of Virginia. 	The Program was established to create a “hotline” system to receive
auto theft related tips from citizens. 	Callers who provide information that leads to the arrest of individuals for
auto theft related crimes are eligible for a cash reward of up to $10,000.00. 	Numerous awards have been paid
over the past ten years, including several which have been for the full amount of $10,000.00. 	
The HEAT Program provides funding in the form of grants to local law-enforcement agencies. 	The funding
provided is used for enforcement training, prevention initiatives, and public awareness. 	Eight sworn members
and the secretarial position of the Auto Theft Unit are funded through the HEAT program. HEAT Program
Administrator is also a part of the Auto Theft Unit. 		
Crime Scene Examination – The Division is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the Division of

	believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to
	determine the extent of such insurance fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state and local police,
	other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units, and any other person;
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud that, in its judgment,
	require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations. 	
IFD currently has 19 special agent positions located strategically throughout the state. Their primary focus is
on fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2-178, taking money
under false pretenses. The law now requires that if insurance professionals have reason to believe that
someone is violating this statute, they are compelled to disclose this information to the Department of State
Police. Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging burglaries, fraudulently
reporting theft and Workers’ Compensation injuries. The Division is constantly uncovering some newly
developed “scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving claim funds from insurance carriers. 	
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured citizen approximately $200 in additional
insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the cost of goods and services. This Division is
dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of Virginia. The
hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected insurance fraud receives frequent activity. The
toll-free telephone number is: 1-877-62FRAUD. 	
Last year there were 94 calls received through the toll free hotline service. A reward program has been
established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of
individuals committing insurance fraud. IFD will operate the reward program by use of the insurance fraud
hotline, as well as through information obtained during investigations, and information provided by the general
public. A reward committee will be selected to make recommendations based on written policy and
procedures. Their recommendations will be forwarded through channels to the Superintendent for final
approval. 		
An Internet web site is available to the general public and provides information on the various aspects of
insurance fraud. 	Additionally, this electronic reporting system provides the insurance industry and the general
public the capability to submit online to the IFD incidents of suspected insurance fraud. 	This service is

available through the Department’s web site and through the Stamp Out Fraud web site. The addresses are:

During 2002, the Insurance Fraud Division received 1,022 notifications of potential property and casualty 	
insurance fraud from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies, and the general public. There were
191 criminal investigations initiated resulting in 72 cases being prosecuted, which led to 105 criminal charges
for insurance fraud and related offenses. The courts ordered $108,474 in restitution during 2002. 	
Insurance fraud has a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of claimed
loss that was actually received by individuals submitting suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2002, in
cases handled by the Insurance Fraud Division there was close to $2 million that was actually collected by 	
individuals suspected of insurance fraud. This was a reduction of almost $400,000 from the previous year that
was not collected due to the efforts by the insurance industry and law enforcement to prevent these losses.
The total amount involved in suspicious claims that were attempted, but not collected was $6.9 million for 	
2002. 			
	BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS (BFO) 		
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000 miles of state 	
roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic
enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the ability of local law 	
enforcement to respond. 	The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection
Program, the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Special 	
Operations Division. 			
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police services into 	
seven field divisions. 	These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or
more cities and/or counties. 	Manpower is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county 	
level. 			
Special Operations Division 			
Recent reorganization within the department re-designated the Special Operations Division as the Special 	
Operations Unit and expanded the duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit will carry out the
B.F.O. Homeland Security responsibilities related to response and recovery operations. 	The seven areas will
serve to coordinate response of other resources and be core members of the Statewide Regional Response
Teams. 			
The unit changed to the Counter Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (C.C.I.) effective January 10, 2003. 	The
Counter Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (C.C.I.) will also continue with efforts in criminal interdiction and
providing assistance to localities as requested. 			
The Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (C.C.I.) became fully staffed and operational in May 2003.
C.C.I. is composed of seven distinct areas throughout the State that corresponds geographically with our field
divisions. 	Each area is staffed with a sergeant-in-charge, a special agent, and several troopers, including all
the narcotics canine handlers. 	C.C.I. Unit Headquarters is located in Chesterfield County, and the Unit 	
Commander reports directly to the Bureau of Field Operations. 		
The C.C.I. Unit carries out the B.F.O. Homeland Security responsibilities related to response and recovery 	
operations in the event of acts of terrorism. 	The areas serve to coordinate response of other resources and be
core members of the statewide regional response teams. 	C.C.I. will also continue with efforts in criminal 	
interdiction and providing assistance to localities as requested.

	LYNCHBURG CITY/STATE PARTNERSHIP 	
The City of Lynchburg Police Department and the Virginia State Police, Special Operations Division, Area 76
and BFO Division III joined resources on October 17, 2002, for a 60-day city/state partnership. 	The West
Team concluded the Lynchburg City/State Partnership on January 9, 2003. 	The purpose of this partnership
was to address the problem of gang-related violence and open-air drug markets, which has plagued certain
communities in the City of Lynchburg. 					
Specifically targeted in the enforcement efforts were crimes associated with drugs and the violence spawned
by identified members of the street gangs known as the “Crips” and “Bloods.” 	Efforts were focused on the
eradication of gang violence and the “open air drug markets” that now exist. 		
Notable arrests for the Lynchburg City/State Partnership included: the arrest of a principle street gang enforcer
of the “Crips,” who was a major target for the city/state partnership; one outstanding federal warrant arrest;
numerous arrests for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute; the arrest of a wanted subject on a
local warrant; and the arrest of a recently paroled convicted felon.

Operation Alert 		
Operation Alert is a program especially designed to interdict criminal activity on the highways of Virginia.
Specialized training is provided to troopers to heighten their awareness when engaged in traffic stops and
during public contacts, urging the trooper to look for unusual circumstances that typically indicate criminal
conduct and activity. 		
The Department's efforts in Operation Alert during 2002 resulted in troopers making a total of 8,624 Operation
Alert Traffic Stops, resulting in 4,088 arrests, and the filing of 3,160 criminal charges. Sworn personnel
removed an estimated $ 1,186,648 worth of narcotics and dangerous drugs from Virginia’s highways. 	In
addition, troopers seized $309,321 in currency and 173 weapons as a result of the Department's enforcement
effort. 		
Aviation Unit 		
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the administration and 	
coordination of the Department’s aviation resources. The Unit operates seven helicopters and four airplanes
from four bases located in Lynchburg, Manassas, Abingdon, and Richmond, Virginia. The Unit’s primary
mission is to provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical evacuation. During its’ 19 year
existence, the Aviation Unit has recorded 74,054 flight hours responding to 45,419.00 flight requests. During
2001, the Department replaced its four Bell 206 helicopters with Bell 407 helicopters. 	The Department has
added an American Eurocopter Corporation BK117 to the two American Eurocopter B0-105’s which have been
in service sine 1993. 	These three helicopters are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 	
Medical Evacuation 		
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve Central and Southwest
Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced medical procedures, and transportation of
critically injured patients to a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the
citizens residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to
calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1,
1987 and responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began
operations on September 1, 2000, and responds to calls for assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-
Route 29 corridor to Danville and in a 60-mile radius of Lynchburg. In 2002, all 3 programs responded to a total
of 1,299 requests with 877 patients transported. The total number of flights for all three programs from April 1,
1984 to December 31, 2002 was 12,871 responses to calls with 9,219 patients transported as a result of these
calls. 		
Search and Rescue 		
During 2002 the Aviation Unit responded to 451 requests for searches for escapees, missing persons,
criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward Looking Infra-Red system on two helicopters and a 30
million-candlepower searchlight on the other helicopters, the Unit has been successful in locating fugitives,
missing persons, and lost children. During this period the Unit also recovered 10 missing vehicles. 	As a result,
13 arrests were made. 		
Surveillance 		
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2002, the Unit was requested 25 times for
drug or narcotic surveillance, 77 times for other criminal matters and 72 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 13
arrests were made and 5,577 marijuana plants were located at a value of $5,577.00 	
Other Duties 		
The Aviation Unit provides aerial support to any Federal, State, or municipal agency whereby the solution of a
police problem or mission may be obtained. During 2002 the Unit provided aerial support to 134 agencies
external to the Department of State Police. These flights included photographing crime scenes, providing
support for presidential motorcades, participating in multi-agency task force efforts, and demonstrations of the
capabilities of the Aviation Unit’s aircraft. Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002, the Aviation Unit
flew 3,413 hours responding to 3,030 flight requests.

Motorist Assistance Program 			
The Motorist Assistance Program currently operates in the four largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with
operations in Chesapeake, Fairfax, Richmond and in the Roanoke/Salem areas. 	During 2002, motorist 	
assistance aides provided assistance to disabled or stranded motorist on more than 54,385 occasions. 	
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires, providing gasoline, jump-
starting vehicles, traffic control, and making cellular phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family
members of a stranded motorist's situation. 	Motorist assistance aides also were instrumental in the arrest of
drunk drivers and aggressive drivers by reporting erratic driving behavior to troopers who subsequently made
t he apprehension. 			
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 		
The Department has 55 commercial vehicle enforcement officers whose primary responsibilities include the
inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. 	During
2002, approximately 11 million commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations for
inspection. 	Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, commercial
vehicle enforcement officers issued 80,817 summonses and made 401 criminal arrests. 	This program is vital
to Virginia's overall highway safety program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized
vehicles; through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and
through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a
commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 			
Crime Prevention 			
During 2002, the Department provided specialized training in Crime Prevention and Personal Safety to 	
selected troopers throughout the State. 	Participating troopers received training in "Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design" (CPTED), business security and techniques to promote personal safety. 	The training
was part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that enabled troopers to achieve certification as crime
prevention specialists through the Department of Criminal Justice Services. 		
During 2002, certified crime prevention troopers provided 3,766 various programs to approximately 140,000
citizens of Virginia, and distributed nearly 70,000 informational handouts. Troopers conducted 599 crime
prevention programs and 829 Safety Programs. In addition, 124 programs were conducted to address 	
personal safety, 76 programs addressed the issues of road rage, 14 workplace violence workshops were held,
and 15 programs were sponsored on recognizing and preventing schemes and scams. 		
Crime prevention troopers also conducted CPTED assessments on 808 businesses and on 5 residences.
Additionally, during 2002, troopers conducted 36 drug education programs, 27 class action programs, and 5
HEAT programs to enhance safety in Virginia communities. 		
Specialty Teams 			
Each of the seven field divisions deploys tactical teams, canine teams and SCUBA teams. 	These teams are
available 24 hours a day to assist local law enforcement agencies or State Police personnel. 	Tactical teams
assist in the execution of high-risk search or arrest warrants and in dealing with hostage situations. 	Canine
teams are available to track lost persons or fugitives, search for suspects of crimes, and detect illegal drugs or
explosives. SCUBA teams are used to recover drowning victims or evidence of criminal activity. 		
In 2002, Patrol Canine Teams responded to 164 requests of which 80 were from Department personnel and 84
were from other state and local law enforcement agencies. 	These requests resulted in 47 felony and 14 	
misdemeanor arrests. 			
Additionally, the Department's Explosive/Weapons Detector Canine Teams responded to 812 requests. 	These
calls resulted in the recovery of six weapons and one explosive device.

Table: 24
Also in 2002, the Department's Narcotic Detection Canine Teams responded to 694 requests for assistance.
These responses resulted in 224 arrests and 204 drug seizures. 	The narcotics seized had an estimated street
value of $2,989,348. 	A total of $528,181 in cash and $236,375 in other property were also seized. 	
The Academy trained two Accelerant Detector Canine Teams. 	These two teams responded to 50 requests of
which 40 were from the Department and 10 from other State and Federal law enforcement agencies. 	The
Canine Teams had 12 alerts inside buildings and 18 alerts to evidence samples collected. 	
The Department maintains fully equipped and highly qualified SCUBA teams throughout Virginia. 	Each team is
trained in the techniques of underwater rescue, search and recovery. 	In 2002, the State Police SCUBA teams
recovered the bodies of 12 drowning victims, 18 weapons, three of which were murder weapons, 7 vehicles
and retrieved property valued at over $260,000. 	
Within each of the seven State Police field divisions, a Tactical Operation Team is maintained. 	These teams
are available to assist local agencies and other State Police members in the arrest and apprehension of
individuals known to pose a threat to law enforcement officials and in other situations where there is a risk to
police officer safety. 	During 2002, State Police Tactical Teams assisted in the execution of 73 search warrants
and drug raids, 5 instances of barricaded suspects, 13 searches for escapees, and three search and rescue
missions. 	These teams also participated in 46 marijuana eradication initiatives, 36 surveillance operations, 31
incidents to provide protection for canine handlers, and 68 other related missions. 	
Tactical Team personnel made a total of 149 arrests resulting in 285 charges, recovered 191 weapons and
seized an estimated $11,206,947 worth of illegal narcotics. 	
Safety Division 		
With the implementation of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program in 1932, Virginia embarked upon and has
continued in a leadership role in the promotion of highway safety. 	
As of December 31, 2002, there were 4,087 active inspection stations located throughout the Commonwealth
of Virginia. There were 13,246 licensed safety inspectors who performed approximately 7,070,650 inspections
at appointed stations during 2002. Approximately 19 percent (1,349,350 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for
inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 	
This Division investigated 3,434 inspection complaints, which resulted in 3,084 instances of disciplinary action
against 61 stations for various classes of offenses and the suspension of 44 inspection stations. 	These
statistics include administrative errors made by inspection stations, and the majority of errors/complaints were
corrected by counseling sessions. 		
Disciplinary action was also taken against 1,111 safety inspectors, resulting in 130 suspensions. 	
Safety Division personnel conducted 1,272 business security checks. 	
Motor Carrier Safety - The Motor Carrier Safety teams work diligently to ensure that trucks and buses meet
safety requirements on Virginia's highways. 	During 2002, Motor Carrier Safety troopers conducted 39,134 in-
depth inspections on heavy commercial vehicles and 8,500 of these, or 21.7 percent, were placed out of
service for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of hazardous materials.
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 62 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2002 and conducted 244
post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents. 	Troopers assigned to the Motor
Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other interested groups on motor carrier
safety and hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training seminars.
Field Support - Safety Division sworn employees provided support for local field divisions during all major
C.A.R.E. holidays. 	During 2002, Safety Division troopers issued 12,049 arrests/summonses, investigated 294
motor vehicle crashes, assisted local troopers with the investigation of 602 motor vehicle crashes, and assisted
7,914 disabled motorists.
