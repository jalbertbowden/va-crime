		THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT 			
				OF STATE POLICE 					
				ANNUAL REPORT 					
			2010 FACTS AND FIGURES 			
			SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE 			
The Virginia Department of State Police is divided primarily into three Bureaus:
Administrative 	and 	Support 	Services, 	Criminal 		Investigation, 	and 	Field
Operations. 												
Each Bureau Director, who holds the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, reports directly
to the Deputy Superintendent. 								
The Superintendent’s Office includes the Executive Protective Unit, Professional
Standards Unit, the Office of Performance Management and Internal Controls,
a nd the Public Relations Office.

Internal Audit Section 											
Internal Audit performs audits and reviews of Virginia State Police operations for
the purpose of monitoring the agency’s performance in maximizing the efficiency
and effectiveness of Department operations and strengthening internal controls.
Internal auditors follow professional auditing standards and carry out the scope of
their work in an independent and objective manner. Results of all internal audits
are 	reported 		to 	management 	and 	the 	Superintendent, 	along 	with 	relevant
recommendations for improvement. Some of the common types of internal audits
include: 																
• 	Review 	of 	the 	reliability 	of 	financial 	data 	and 	related 	financial 	reporting 	of
	operations 														
• 	Review of compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures

Table: 3
• 	Conducting the annual Citizen Survey 							
During 	2010, 	the 	Planning 	and 	Research 	Section 	administered 	44 	grants 	that
provided approximately $14.9 million in funding for agency projects. 		
Accreditation 														
In August 2010, Virginia State Police underwent and achieved reaccreditation by
the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The
Department 	was 	fully 	compliant 	with 	the 	accreditation 	standards 	and 	received
many favorable reviews from the public input component of the evaluation. 	
Virginia State Police has been a longstanding supporter and advocate of CALEA,
as the Department, in 1985, became the second state law-enforcement agency
in the nation to receive official accreditation by CALEA. 					
Maintaining 	accredited 		status 	is 	an 	on-going 	project 	for 	all 	accredited 	law
enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic updating of
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law
enforcement standards. 		In December 2005, the Department was one of eleven
agencies 	awarded 	a 	Certificate 	of 	Meritorious 	Accreditation 	for 	successfully
maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 						
The 	purpose 	of 	the 	accreditation 	process 	is 	to 	improve 	the 	delivery 	of 	law
enforcement 	services 	by 	demonstrating 	that 	an 	agency’s 	operations 	are 	in
compliance 	with 	generally 	accepted 	standards. 	Accreditation 	requires 	a
comprehensive 	review 		of 	every 	aspect 	of 	the 	Department’s 		organization,
operations, and administration. 										
Public Relations Office 									
The 	Public 	Relations 	Office 	(PRO) 	is 	responsible 	for 	planning, 	developing,
managing and implementing comprehensive, proactive, statewide public relations
information and educational programs regarding the Department. 	In addition to
maintaining daily contact with the public and media, the PRO disseminates news
releases about Department programs and activities, traffic safety enforcement,
and crime prevention. The office also develops and implements highway safety
and public awareness media campaigns and conducts press interviews around
the state. 															
The PRO staff consists of a Public Relations Manager and two Public Relations
Coordinators at State Police Administrative Headquarters. The Public Relations
Office assists and supports the Department’s Public Information Officers (PIO)
assigned 	to 	four 	of 	the 	seven 	field 	divisions. 	PIO’s 	respond 	to 	the 	scenes 	of
major highway crashes, criminal incidents, and handle regional press inquiries in
order to assist the media in providing direct and timely information to the public.

		and the Virginia Statewide Interoperability Executive Committee (SIEC)
The 	Division 	provides 		engineering, 	maintenance, 	inventory 		control, 		asset
management, configuration management, and operations services for the STARS
Network. 	The Division also supports the land mobile radio, mobile data and legacy
radio systems of the Commonwealth’s 21 STARS participating state-level public
safety 	and 	service 	agencies. 	The 	STARS 	Network 	is 	supported 	24/7 	by 	the
STARS Network Operations Center (NOC). 									
The STARS project provides a private data network with statewide geographical
coverage allowing units to operate mobile computer terminals through the radio.
Mobile 	data 	use 	has 	now 	been 	expanded 	to 	the 	entire 	state 	with 	supplemental
wireless data throughout all divisions. 										
The Communications Division provides design, engineering, maintenance, and
technical support for the Commonwealth Link to Interoperable Communications
(COMLINC) 	project 		that 	consolidated 	the 	efforts 	of 	several 	regions 	of 	the
Commonwealth to provide interoperability between the Virginia State Police and
with and among localities and other state and federal agencies. 		The hardware
and software has been purchased through federal grants.

Table: 7
In 	order 	to 	solidify 	these 	various 	projects 	an 	engineer 		was 	funded 		and 	all
maintenance and administration was assumed by the Communications Division.
The project currently encompasses 57 of 134 localities and a number of state
and federal agencies. 	Discussions with other regions are ongoing. 				
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid
entry and retrieval of data associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The
CAD system consists of 15 servers, 50 dispatch terminals, and over 100 remote
access users. 		A real time data feed is supplied from CAD to VDOT to facilitate
rapid response to incidents impacting traffic. 										
The 	Virginia 	State 	Police 	CAD 	Management 	Information 	System 	(MIS) 	is 	a
database containing all incident and unit information collected in CAD since March
1999. 	CAD historical data is transferred to MIS every two hours. 	The database
currently holds in excess of 6,000,000 records. 		In 2010, 907,888 incidents were
recorded in the CAD systems. 	An Intranet Web page allows VSP network users to
create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. 	An Intranet Web
site allows users to view real time CAD incidents. 	The MIS database allows the
Department 	to 	track 	and 	access 	information 	never 	before 	available, 		such 	as
average response times, and total number of calls. 									
The Mobile Management System provides support for over 2,500 vehicle terminals
currently deployed. 	The users supported include troopers, other state agencies,
and local sheriffs’ offices and police departments. 	This system allows user access
to VCIN/NCIC, text messaging, and for the troopers, full CAD functionality. 			
Telephone 	systems 	and 	cabling 	have 	been 	replaced 		at 	Administrative
Headquarters with new copper and fiber optic cable service. 	Telephone system
upgrades 	are 		continuing 	as 	needed 	at 	area 	offices 	and 	division 	headquarters
statewide. 																	
In 	addition 	to 	mission-critical 	communications, 	the 		Communications 	Division
coordinates and supports wireless communications equipment and services. 	The
Division 	constantly 	monitors 	wireless 		services 	to 	provide 	better 	coverage 	and
increased 	technical 	support. 	This 	effort 	supports 	the 	current 	mandated 	budget
reductions 	with 	significant 	savings 	to 	the 	Department 	of 	State 	Police 	and 	the
taxpayers 	in 	the 	Commonwealth. 	These 	services 	make 		Department 	personnel
more 	accessible 	and 	keep 	them 		better 	informed 	regarding 	routine 	and
administrative activities. 	The number of wireless telephones approved and in use
has been reduced to a little over 900 units in support of recent budget reductions.
Current cellular services are allowing the elimination of pagers in most areas of
operations as the wireless carriers build out the more rural areas. 					
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems
for special events as they occur.

		Hill, Foxfield, Gold Cup races; Galax Fiddler’s Convention; 	various tactical
		operations 													
	4. 	Security and traffic control for the Virginia State Fair in Caroline County 	
All 	field 	division 	radio 	shops 		are 	certified 	as 	independent 	laboratories 	by 	the
Division of Consolidated Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating 2,869 radar
tuning forks. 	The present inventory of active radars is approximately 1,440 units
and 273 lidar units. 	The majority of the Department radars are the newer Golden
Eagle II units. 														
The Division provides statewide telephone services and local area network wiring
for 	the 	Department 	and 	other 		state 	agencies. 	The 	Division 	currently 	maintains
approximately 21,500 items of radio equipment for the state’s public service and
public safety agencies. 	The Division will be responsible for over 60,000 items of
STARS equipment once the network is fully implemented. 	Depot level repair will
be 	performed 	in 	the 	Communications 	Division, 	a 	great 	savings 	over 	all 	other
alternatives. 															
The Communications Division has actively participated with the Capital Wireless
Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN) activities to
improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. 				
The 	Communications 	Division 		serves 	as 	Virginia’s 	Frequency 	Advisor 	for 	the
Association 	of 	Public-Safety 	Communications 	Officials 	(APCO), 	the 	Federal
Communications Commission’s designated agent. 	The duties include: 			
	• 	Preparation 	of 	new 	and 	modified 	FCC 	license 	applications 	for 	localities
		and agencies throughout the Commonwealth as requested 				
	• 	Coordinate 	applications 	processed 	through 	APCO 	headquarters 	with

Criminal Justice Information Services Division 			
The 	Criminal 		Justice 	Information 	Services 	Division 		is 	responsible 	for 	the
maintenance of all files within the Department. 	This includes the implementation,
monitoring, destruction, and archiving of 	records in accordance with the State
Police Records Retention Schedule. 									
In 	2010, 	the 	Division 	processed 	and 	responded 	to 	3,355 	subpoenas 	and 	333
Freedom of Information Act requests. 									
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 							
The 	Criminal 	Investigative 	Reports 	Section 	received 	and 	processed 	273,759
criminal investigative reports in 2010, a decrease of 4% from 2009. 			
In 	2010, 	the 		Central 	Criminal 	Records 	Exchange 	(CCRE) 	received 	1,995
Notifications 	of 	Suspected 	Alien 	Reporting 	forms 	from 	Virginia 	probation 	and
parole officers subsequent to convictions in circuit courts or referrals to probation
or parole officers or for probation supervision, pursuant to Section 19.2-294.2,
Code of Virginia. 													
The CCRE completed 3,137 expungements of police and court records, or 362
more than in 2009, which represents an increase of 12%. 					
In 2010, the CCRE responded to and completed 169 challenges by citizens to
the existence or accuracy of their criminal history record. The 2009 total was 215.
In 2010, the CCRE received 9,193 legal name change court orders, a process
that 	requires 	the 	querying 	of 	the 	CCH 	Name 	File 	in 	order 	to 	determine 	the
existence of a criminal history record, and if determined, results in the addition of
the 	court-ordered 	name 	change 	to 	the 	CCH 	Name 	File, 	archival 	of 	the 	court
order, and notification to the FBI to add the new name. 	Criminal history records
were identified for 1,531 of the total name changes received. 				
In 2010, the CCRE generated 979 Concealed Handgun Permit court notification
letters, an increase of 114, since 2009. The notifications are routinely made to
the circuit court that issued the permit, the court where the case was or will be
adjudicated, 		with 	a 	copy 	forwarded 	to 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 	of 	the
jurisdiction 	that 	issued 	the 	permit 	and 	the 	commonwealth 	attorney 	of 	the
jurisdiction of the adjudicating court. 									
The CCRE processed 25,338 adult and juvenile fingerprint cards using the NIST
card scanning equipment to scan the mug shot, data enter demographics from
the print cards into the CCH file and scan the fingerprint card bar code. The total
for 2009 was 34,381.

Non-Criminal Justice Program (NCJI) 									
The Non Criminal Justice Section processed a total of 74,279 fingerprint based
searches and 236,984 name search requests for 2010. 	On February 8, 1996,
the Non Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented due to the constant
growth 	and 	demand 	for 	criminal 	history 	record 	requests. 		This 	interface
eliminates the requirement for CCRE staff to receive and process a high volume
of “paper record name-search” requests. 								
In 2010, CCRE staff processed 114,943 paper inquiries or 48.5% and 122,041 or
51.5% electronic name transmissions received from participants with an average
response 	time 	of 	72 	hours 	or 	less. 	Of 	the 	total 	paper 	record 	name 	search
requests, 69,218 or 60.2% inquiries were submitted on the bar-coded criminal
history request forms and the remaining 45,725 or 39.8% were submitted on the
non bar-coded forms. 	The bar coded method of automation has tremendously
enhanced customer service by reducing turn around time. 						
Mental Health File 													
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the
ability 	to 	purchase 	a 	firearm(s). 	Official 	notifications 	of 	individuals 	in 	these
categories 	are 		received 	from 	clerks 	of 	courts 	upon 	court 	adjudication 	of 	an
individual 	(1) 	acquitted 	by 	reason 		of 	insanity, 	(2) 	involuntarily 	admitted 	to
inpatient 	or 	outpatient 	treatment, 	(3) 		adjudicated 	mentally 	incapacitated 	or
incompetent 	or 	(4) 	is 	the 	subject 	of 	a 	temporary 	detention 	order 	(TDO) 	and
agreed to voluntary admission. 	As of December 31, 2010, there were 19,777
mental 	health 	records 	added 	bringing 	the 	total 	records 	on 	file 	to 	145,365. 	In
2010, the CCRE received 56 notifications of restoration of capacity or right to
purchase, possess or transport a firearm. Reviewing this file when an application
to purchase is being processed has prevented the transfer of a firearm in 215
instances in 2010. 														
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 					
Within one year, the number of searches against the Sex Offender Registry for
employment-licensure purposes has decreased. 							
	9 	The SOR experienced a 4% decrease. 							
	9 	In 2010, there were 155,726 searches. 							
	9 	A decrease of 6,426 searches compared to 2009. 						
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular,
by 	providing 	personal 	descriptive 	and 	sentencing 	information 	on 	individuals
convicted 	of 	certain 		sex 	crimes. 	Information 	regarding 	registered 	offenders
which includes a photograph is maintained on the internet. 					
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 21,450 fingerprint-based registrations
received since July 1, 1997.

The Sex Offender Investigative Unit 								
The Sex Offender Investigative Unit conducts criminal investigations related to
offenders required to register. 	In 2010, 2,506 criminal investigations were 		
initiated, which is a 5.8% decrease from 2009. 							
The Unit verifies addresses of registered sexual offenders. 	Registered offenders
require semi-annual address verification and an additional verification within 30
days of a change to their home or employment addresses information. 	During
2010, troopers confirmed 17,135 addresses which represents a 6.6% increase in
verifications from 2009. 											
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 					
The Interface consists of 118 Circuit Courts, 130 General District Courts, and 124
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE.
In 	2010, 	an 	estimated 	400,274 	records 	were 	transmitted, 	negating 	the
requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE.
Of all dispositions transmitted, an estimated 10.5% were rejected. 			
In 	February 	2000, 	the 	arrest/disposition 	monitoring 	system 	was 	implemented.
Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated
for missing arrest fingerprint cards. 									
For 	2010, 	notifications 	to 	courts 	and 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	for 	1,196
individual charges were generated, a decrease of 65%, due to the elimination of
computer-generated 	letters 	to 	courts, 	a 	costly 	process 	that 	yielded 	minimal
results during the past several years. The notifications were generated because
the court did/could not include the Document Control Number when transmitting
their 	data 	or 	when 	the 	court 	transmitted 	the 	Document 	Control 	Number, 	but
CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file. 					
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 						
As 	of 	December 	31, 	2010, 	there 	were 	196,203 	offenders 	on 	file 	with
commitments 	received 	from 	the 	Virginia 	Department 		of 	Corrections, 	which
accounts for 10.7% of the total records maintained in the CCRE. 				
The Central Criminal Records Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status
Information 	on 	a 	weekly 	basis. 	The 	Correctional 	Status 	Information 	Interface
improved 	the 	criminal 	history 	information 	by 	providing 	up-to-date 	correctional
information with minimal error.

The Microfilm Section 														
This section archived 755,749 documents during 2010, a decrease of 183,941
documents, or 2% since 2009. This decrease is due to one employee retirement,
several long-term medical absences and one employee promotion and transfer.
Photographic Laboratory 													
The 	Photo 	Lab 	maintains 	records, 	files, 	film, 	and 	responds 	to 	requests 	for
photographs, 	digital 	images, 	and 	court 		enlargements. 		In 	2010, 	there 	were
126,819 photographic prints, a decrease of 1,149, developed for use by sworn
personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal
cases in 2010. 	The lab also received and processed 372 compact discs (CD) a
decrease 	of 	85%. 	This 	decrease 	is 	due 	to 	the 	Digital 	Crime 	Scene 	Images
(DCSI) 	increased 	usage 	by 	the 	agents 	and 	troopers 	and 	their 		increasing
familiarity with the system. 														
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 						
This statewide computer system searches and stores rolled fingerprints and palm
prints from criminal arrests, sex offenders and partial latent fingerprints recovered
from crime scenes. 	The central components of this system are located at State
Police 	Administrative 	Headquarters. 	The 	Department 	and 	24 	other 	state 	and
local 	agencies 	have 	access 	to 	the 	system 	through 	terminals 	located 	in 	their
respective 	agencies. 		The 	Global 		Transaction 	Controller 	receives 		Live 	Scan
transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and AFIS
systems 	for 	searching 	existing 	criminal 	history 	records 	or 	to 	match 		latent
fingerprints 	against 	known 	criminal 	prints. 	The 	installation 	of 	the 	Electronic
Fingerprint Archive System has enhanced our ability to store and retrieve these
records. 	Currently there are 2,030,304 Virginia unique subject-related fingerprint
files as part of AFIS. 	Additionally, there are 116,525 unsolved latent fingerprints
and 	4,234 	unsolved 	palm 	prints 	in 	the 		database. 	The 	Slap 	database 		has
801,505 images; the Palm database has 126,654 images. 						
During 2010, the fingerprint section processed 297,349 (Inked cards and Live
Scan) 	criminal 	arrest 	records. 	The 	Live 	Scan 	volume 		was 	285,244 	records
(95.9%) and the card scan volume was 12,105 records. 	The fingerprints section
processed 163,426 fingerprint based applicant requests including criminal justice
requests. 		The Live Scan portion of the civil requests totaled 130,284 or 79.7%
and the mailed-in cards totaled 33,142. 										
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 							
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except
antiques, based on the results of a criminal history record information check on
the buyer. 	The VFTP processed 276,765 transactions in 2010. 	Of these, 2,999
were 	denied 	based 	on 	the 	results 	of 	a 	criminal 	history 	record 	check 	or 		the
identification of another disqualifying record. 	During 2010, 145 wanted persons
were 	identified 	for 	extraditable 	offenses, 	which 	resulted 	in 	the 	arrest 		of 	63
individuals 	wanted 	in 	Virginia 	and 	2 	individuals 	who 	were 	named 		in 	an
																	12
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 13 of 47”
Table: 13
outstanding warrant from another state. 	In 2010, the State Police requested 942
criminal investigations related to the illegal sale or attempt to purchase firearms.
Additionally, 	during 		2009, 	1,286 	criminal 	investigations 	for 	the 	illegal 	sale 	or
attempt to purchase a firearm resulted in 871 (68%) cases closed arrests. 		
VCheck 																	
VCheck 	is 	Virginia’s 	Internet 	based 	Instant 	Background 		Check 	program.
Approval numbers are generated in instant clearances, while transactions that
require review or research are routed to the Firearms Transaction Call Center for
processing. 	During 	calendar 	year 	2010, 	approximately 	78% 	of 	the 	total
transactions, 	statewide, 	were 	processed 	via 		the 	Internet. 		As 	on-line 	users
increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and
verification 		processes. 		Additional 	employee 	time 		devoted 		to 	these 	other
processes 	provide 	more 	efficient 	overall 	services 	to 	the 	firearm 	dealers 	and
firearm purchasers and cost savings to the Department and the Commonwealth.
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of
a gun dealer authorized to transfer firearms, and the State Police issues a seller
identification 	number 	for 	qualified 	employees. 	As 	of 	December 	31, 	2010, 	the
State Police issued 10,129 seller identification numbers. 						
Concealed Handgun Permits 												
Since July 1, 1995, 526,633 concealed handgun permits have been issued as
authorized by Section 18.2-308, Code of Virginia; 48,407 were issued in 2010 by
Virginia 	Circuit 	Courts. 	In 	2010, 	the 	State 		Police 	notified 	the 	Circuit 	Courts 	in
1,443 instances of disqualified holders of concealed handgun permits, of which
781 were revoked. 		During 2010, 1,179 nonresident concealed handgun permits
were 	issued 	by 	the 	State 	Police, 	which 	is 	a 	7.9% 	increase 		in 	the 	volume 	of
nonresident 	permits 	issued 	in 	2009. 		Additionally, 	in 	2010, 		the 	State 	Police
revoked 	one 	non-resident 	concealed 	handgun 	permit 	upon 	the 	holder’s
disqualification. 																
In 	accordance 	with 		the 	Code 	of 	Virginia, 		the 	State 		Police 	enters 	the 	permit
holder’s 	name 	and 		description 	in 	the 	Virginia 	Criminal 	Information 	Network
(VCIN) so that the permit's existence and current status will be made known to
law-enforcement 	personnel 	accessing 	the 	Network 	for 	investigative 	purposes.
As of December 31, 2010, there were 238,395 active concealed handgun permits
issued by Virginia circuit courts maintained in VCIN. 							
Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) 						
The Uniform Crime/Incident Based Reporting (UCR/IBR) Section is responsible
for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting (IBR) data from all contributing
law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 Group A criminal offenses
as well as 12 Group B criminal offenses. 	The UCR/IBR office no longer accepts
summary hardcopy reports or data submitted by diskettes. 	Data is submitted via
the Internet through the IBR Web site. 	This is a secure system to which only
State 	Program 	personnel 	and 	contributing 		agencies 		have 	access. 	Each 	day
																	13
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 14 of 47”
Table: 14
submitted files are run through the edit process. 	This procedure generates an
error report so that agencies may correct any incidents that failed to be sent to
the IBR central repository database. 	A monthly file of Virginia’s data is generated
and 	emailed 	to 	the 	National 	Program 	(FBI) 	for 	inclusion 		in 	their 	annual
publication, Crime in the United States. 											
During 2010, the UCR/IBR office assisted local agencies on a daily basis with
training 	issues, 	interpretation 	of 	error 	reports, 	and 	clarifications 	in 	offense
definitions 	and 	reporting 	procedures, 	as 	well 	as 	assisted 	computer 	software
vendors 	with 	reporting 	issues. 	Agencies 	were 	asked 	to 	review 	nearly 	23,000
offenses 	regarding 	quality 	control 	issues, 	make 	the 	necessary 		changes 	and
resubmit 	their 	data. 	The 	IBR 	responded 	to 	an 	estimated 	5,000 	phone 	calls
regarding varied IBR issues from agencies and vendors as well as receiving or
sending over 4,800 messages using electronic mail. 								
There are 19 private vendors with software that transforms agency crime data
into an approved IBR format. 	In addition, several large agencies have built their
own 	in-house 	software 	systems. 	Monthly 	and 	quarterly 	statistical 	reports 	are
now 	posted 	on 	the 	IBR 	Web 	site 	rather 	than 	having 	to 	be 		mailed 	to 	each
contributing agency. 	The UCR/IBR office responded daily to requests for crime
statistics 	from 	state 	agencies, 	government 	officials, 	students, 		media, 	and 	the
general public. 																
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletter as well as, the annual
report, 	Crime 	in 	Virginia. 	Commonwealth’s 	Attorneys, 	judges, 	legislators, 	and
other state agencies are also informed of the availability of Crime in Virginia. 	In
2004, 	this 	annual 	report 	was 	published 	for 	the 	first 	time 	on 	a 	CD 	rather 	than
hardcopy. 	Beginning in 2007, the annual report has been available exclusively
through 	the 	State 	Police 	Web 	site. 	This 	report 	contains 	Group 	A 	offenses
submitted by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B
arrests by counties and cities in Virginia. 	These data comprise the official crime
statistics for Virginia and are used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate
forecasting, and in the legislative process. 										
The IBR contributing agency Web site went into production in 2002. 	Currently,
there are 281 agencies that have the ability to submit their monthly data through
the 	Internet. 	This 	Web 	site 	provides 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	with 	the
convenience 	of 	on-line 	monthly 	data 	submission, 	receiving 		timely 		error
notifications, 	monthly 	and 	year-to-date 	statistical 	reports, 	performing 	searches
and 	ad 	hoc 	reporting, 	viewing 	manuals, 	bulletins, 	and 	posting 	inquiries 	in 	the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. 										
The 2010 Crime in Virginia report will be available in the spring of 2011. Since
2008, this report has been formatted and published within the IBR Unit which has
reduced expenses and provides an earlier distribution date.

Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information
Center (NCIC) 																
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 687 member agencies with 32,118 certified
operators. 		The 	system 	has 	12,066 	terminals, 		of 	which 	3,538 	are 	non-mobile
terminals and 8,528 are mobile terminals. 	In 2010, VCIN processed 416,061,076
transactions 	(an 	increase 	of 	3% 	over 	the 	2009 	totals) 	between 	NCIC/NLETS
member agencies and state computer databases. 								
Virginia 		agencies 	entered 	numerous 	types 	of 	information 	in 	the 	VCIN/NCIC
system, 		which 	is 	critical 	to 	law 	enforcement 	officers. 	As 	an 	example, 	these
systems 		store 	information 	relating 	to 	wanted 		persons, 	missing 	persons, 	and
stolen vehicles, and protective orders. 	Enhancements in the “E-Magistrate” and
“Hotfiles” 	systems 	have 	improved 	the 	statistical 	information 	available 	through
VCIN/NCIC. 	In 2010, there were 179,589 warrants entered into the VCIN/NCIC
system. 		VCIN/NCIC 	currently 	retains 	Virginia 	information 	for 	2,372 	missing
adults, 10,512 missing children, and 10,534 stolen vehicles. 					
In 	2009, 	for 	the 	first 	time, 	system 	enhancements 	allowed 	VCIN 	to 	track 	the
number 		of 	protective 	order 	transactions 	throughout 	the 	period 	instead 	of 	the
number of orders on file at any given time. 	In 2010, there were 11,446 Orders of
Protection, 	13,029 	Preliminary 		Protective 	Orders, 		and 	35,900 	Emergency
Protective Orders entered into the VCIN system. 								
E-Magistrate 																
In 	2009, 	the 	Supreme 	Court 	of 	Virginia 	implemented 	an 	automated 	interface
named E-Magistrate. 	This automated interface permits warrants and Protective
Orders issued by magistrates to be automatically entered into VCIN and NCIC.
This streamlined process ensures that data is available to law enforcement within
thirty minutes of the issuance of the aforementioned legal documents. 	In 2010,
there were 99,371 records entered into VCIN/NCIC through this interface. 		
Availability of Department of Motor Vehicle Images via VCIN 				
Virginia DMV images are available to Virginia law enforcement agencies through
the Virginia State Police, Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) using the
OpenFox Messenger application. 	Alternatively, they will be available to interface
agencies 	that 	have 	completed 		the 	programming 	to 	their 	VCIN 	interface 	as
advised. 		In 	2010, 	the 	VCIN 	system 	processed 	an 	average 	of 	over 	43,000
requests per month from law enforcement agencies for DMV images. 			
Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse 						
The Virginia Missing Children Information Clearinghouse was formed by an act of
the Virginia General Assembly on July 1, 1983. 		The clearinghouse is to assist in
the implementation of federal and state laws relating to missing children, and the
inclusion 	of 	programs 	to 	coordinate 	efforts 	between 	local, 	state, 	and 	federal
agencies in recovering missing children and promoting community awareness of
the issue. 		The Clearinghouse operates as Virginia’s center for missing children
																		15
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 16 of 47”
Table: 16
administered through the Virginia Department of State Police. The clearinghouse
is linked to all Virginia law enforcement agencies through the VCIN system and
all 	United 	States 	police 	agencies 	through 	NCIC 	and 		the 	National 	Center 	for
Missing and Exploited Children. 										
Virginia Amber Alert System 										
A 	new 	system 	was 	developed 	in 	March 	2006 	to 	automate 	the 	entry 	and
notification process for Virginia’s Amber Alert system. 		The system is designed to
provide a comprehensive and rapid broadcast of information that will lead to the
safe recovery of a child and capture of 	the abductor. 		Local law enforcement
agencies can log into the secure Virginia Amber Alert request form, enter the
information and submit it electronically to Virginia State Police. 	The system has
significantly reduced the time required to get this information out to the public. 		
In 	2010, 	five 	requests 	were 	received 	for 	an 	Amber 	Alert 	activation 	and 	three
requests met the criteria and were activated. 	In the two cases where the criteria
was not met, an Endangered Missing Child Alert was issued. 				
Virginia Senior Alert Program 										
Enabling legislation enacted by the 2007 Virginia Assembly created the Virginia
Senior 	Alert 	Program. 	This 	program, 	managed 		by 	the 	Criminal 	Justice
Information Service Division, created policy and guidelines for the State Police to
publicize an incident of a missing senior adult. 	When activated, the information is
publicized at www.vasenioralert.com and through notifying our media partners.
In 2010, the Senior Alert process was activated on seven occasions. 			
Property and Finance Division 								
The 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	encompasses 		a 	wide 	range 	of 	property
management, 	logistical 	and 	financial 	functions. 	It 		was 	responsible 	for 	the
procurement, warehousing and distribution of more than $24,895,665 in supplies
and equipment in 2010. 	The Property and Finance Division is also responsible for
the management and maintenance of 115 buildings and grounds across the state.
The new 14,000 SF garage project at SPHQ was completed in November 2010,

The Property 	and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess
Military 	Property 	Program, 	which 	allows 	Virginia 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 		to
procure, 	at 	no 	cost, 	military 	property 	and 	equipment 	that 	is 	in 	excess 	of 	the
Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as
the point of contact, and provides a state coordinator. 	The program serves over
330 	Virginia 	law 	enforcement 	agencies, 	and 	in 	2010, 	the 	program 	distributed
goods valued over $1,700,000. 												
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-
to-day operational control of the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement
Program, 	“The 	1122 	Program.” 		This 	program 	allows 		state 		and 	local 	law
enforcement 	agencies 	to 	purchase 	law 	enforcement 	equipment 	suitable 	for
counter-narcotic 	activities 	through 	the 	federal 	procurement 	channels 		at
substantial 	savings. 	During 	2010, 	over 		$1,177,326 	worth 	of 	goods 	were
purchased through this program, saving the Department $240,302. 				
The 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	is 	also 	responsible 	for 	the 		preparation 	of,
monitoring, 	and 	accounting 	for 	the 	Department’s 	annual 	budget 	in 	excess 		of
$282 	million 	for 	2010, 	including 	approximately 	$11.4 	million 	of 		federal 	grants.
VSP requested additional appropriation of $581,000 through the Department of
Planning and Budget. 														
The 	Property 		and 	Finance 	Division 	processes 	payments 	to 	vendors 		in
accordance with established policies and procedures issued by various entities,
including, 	but 	not 	limited 	to 	the 	State 	Department 	of 	Accounts 	and 	Federal
agencies. 		Payments 	are 	processed 	in 	compliance 	with 	the 	“Prompt 	Payment
Act.” 																	
Security, 	patrol 	services 	and 	background 	information 	are 	routinely 	provided 	to
other state agencies, localities and private entities for which the Department seeks
reimbursement. 	The Property and Finance Division, along with other Divisions of
the 	Department, 	bills 	for 	these 	services 	provided 	by 	the 	Department. 	It 	is 	the
responsibility of the Property and Finance Division to collect the receivables and
record deposits to the proper accounts, as well as seek alternative solutions to
collect on bad debt. 														
The Property and Finance Division is responsible for seized asset accounting and
case management for drug-related seizures in accordance with applicable state
and 	federal 	guidelines 	and 	reporting 	requirements. 		The 	Property 	and 	Finance
Division is also charged with managing the recently awarded $44 million settlement
related to the Purdue Pharmaceutical case. 										
The 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	prepares 	all 	state 	and 	federal 	reporting 	in
compliance with applicable State and Federal regulations, working with the State
Auditor 	of 	Public 	Accounts 	and 	Federal 	auditors. 	Along 	with 		VSP’s 	Office 	of

support of Virginia State Police's public safety mission and services to the citizens
of the Commonwealth. 	The IT Division is 	responsible for many mission critical
systems and applications which support local, state and federal law enforcement
efforts. 														
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 				
In 	2010, 	the 	VCIN 	system 	processed 	more 	than 		416 	million 	transactions. 	This
represents a 3% increase in volume over the previous year. 				
Also in 2010, an average of over 43,000 DMV photos per month were processed
through VCIN utilizing the NLETS Interstate Sharing of Photos (NISP) project. 		
Firearms System VCheck (Virginia’s Instant Background Check) 			
In 2010, 1,749 firearms dealers used the VCheck automated instant background
check 	system. 	The 	Virginia 	Firearms 	Transaction 	Center 	(FTC) 	processed
276,765 transactions in 2010. 	Of the firearms transactions processed in 2010,
78% 	were 	directly 	by 	dealers 	using 	VCheck. 		The 	other 	22% 	of 	firearms
transactions were processed by FTC call takers who used VCheck to initiate the
background check. 												
Hot Files (wanted, missing person, stolen vehicles, and protective orders) 	
Over 	179,589 	warrants 	were 	entered 	in 	2010, 	of 	which 	114,731 	were 	received
through the magistrate interface. 	Of the 60,553 total protective orders entered in
2010, over 14,666 were received through court interface and 34,014 were received
through the magistrate interface. 										
Sex Offender Registry (SOR) 										
The 	Sex 	Offender 	Registry 	was 	enhanced 	to 	capture 	victim 	information 	for 	all
offenses and to capture transaction responses from NCIC. 					
During 2010, VSP processed 3,190,169 records from DMV and 975,268 records
from higher education institutions against the Sex Offender Registry. 	There were
7,538 	offender 	photos 	from 	DMV 	that 	were 	uploaded 	to 	the 	registry. 	VSP
processed 	17,135 	sex 	offender 	verifications 	and 	DOC 	processed 	10,120
verifications. 													
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 								
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest
information, including fingerprints, mug shots and palm prints, to the State Police
and the FBI. 	This process enhances an agency’s ability to detect aliases and
														18

Table: 19
outstanding warrants on arrestees prior to their release. 	Fingerprint-based civil
requests 	are 	also 	submitted 	electronically 	and 	provide 		the 	requesting 		agency
with state and FBI responses within 24 hours. 							
During 2010, criminal arrest records and identification bookings were received
and processed from 212 unique Live Scan units throughout the state. 	Likewise,
Correctional records on inmates and probation and parolees were received and
processed 	from 	42 	Live 	Scan 	units. 	In 	2010, 	95.9% 	of 	the 	criminal 	and
correctional transactions processed were received through Live Scan. 		
During 2010, civil submissions were received and processed from a total of 355
unique live scan units; some of these being criminal justice units also used for 	
the purposes of submitting criminal background checks for concealed weapons
permits, criminal justice applicants, etc. 	Seventy-nine percent of the civil 		
transactions processed during 2010 were received through Live Scan. 		
Digital Crime Scene Images (DCSI) 									
DCSI, 	a 	system 	troopers 	and 	agents 	use 	to 	upload 	crime 	scene 	and 	accident
digital images to the Photo Lab, was installed on BCI and BFO desktops, laptops,
and 	mobile 	data 	terminals 	(MDTs) 	in 	2009 	and 	2010. 	In 	2010, 	almost 	5,000
uploads with a total of 136,695 photos were uploaded from 710 field users to the
Photo Lab for same-day or next-day processing, reducing the turnaround time of
prints to the requester by at least seven days. 	Only 1.5% of the photos received
were 	not 	uploaded 		from 	the 	field. 	Ninety-two 	percent 		of 	the 	images 	submitted
needed printing, resulting in a savings of nearly $1,000.00 in printing costs. 	
Central Criminal Image System (CCIS) 									
CCIS receives mug shots and images of scars, marks and tattoos from the AFIS
system. 	Virginia law enforcement agency personnel log in to search for images of
known offenders by State ID (SID) or for suspects by characteristics such as height
and weight range, race, gender, eye color, hair color, etc. 		They can create lineups,
reports, and run facial recognition searches. 	In 2010, 191,856 records with a total
of 262,499 images were added to the system by AFIS. 	Sixty-nine agencies have
access 	to 	CCIS, 	and 	their 	users 	logged 	in 	4,030 	times 	and 	performed 	5,353
searches, created 539 lineups, and printed 2,889 reports. 					
Personnel Division

In April 2010, Divisions V and VI recruiters returned to the Recruitment Unit and in
August 2010, the Sergeant/Division I recruiter returned to the Unit. 			
• 	Recruiters attended minority and female colleges and universities to locate
	prospective applicants. 	Recruiting Lunchbox formats were used on university
	and 	college 	campuses 	within 	their 	divisions. 	Each 	Recruiter 	conducted 	a
	minimum of three programs per month. 	A total of 66 lunchbox events were
	conducted in 2010. 									
• 	Recruiters enlisted at local Civic, Women’s and Minority group venues in an
	effort to facilitate recruiting minority candidates. 	This was established in order
	to provide recruiting campaigns when these groups are holding festivals and to
	directly 	work 	with 	minority 	organizations 	to 	develop 	a 	rapport 	to 	facilitate
	recruitment efforts. 	Recruiters participated in a minimum of three programs per
	month. 		These 	groups 	provide 	valuable 	contact 	information 	within 	their
	organization and the community. 	A total of 59 civic/women’s/minority events
	were conducted in 2010. 								
• 	Military 	Recruitment 	– 	Each 	Recruiter 	provided 	one 	program 	per 	month 	to
	transitioning military personnel. 	Virginia has the most military facilities of any
	state in the nation, and the military offers a very diverse candidate pool. 	A total
	of 22 military events were conducted in 2010. 					
• 	Recruiters 	identified 	Student 	Athlete 	Recruiting 	to 	further 	our 	minority 	and
	female 	recruitment 	efforts. 		Recruiters 	visited 	athletic/health 	facilities 	in

	A total of 17 student athlete events were conducted in 2010. 			
• 	Career Sessions/Public Safety Day events were held in Powhatan, Chesterfield
	and Salem in 2010. 	These sessions provided a regional venue to recruit as
	well as showcase our Department to the community. 	Each event was attended
	by 	many 	prospective 	applicants 	and 	citizens. 	The 	events 	received 	positive
	publicity through statewide radio coverage. 	Three (3) Public Safety Day events
	were conducted. 	Due to the budget shortfall, 21 of the total 211 job fairs were
	conducted at no cost to the Department. 						
• 	Other Recruitment Efforts: 	44 programs were conducted at the request of other
	agencies and vendors throughout the state.

Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 28 of 47”
Table: 28
Crimes Bureau, the Insurance Industry, and federal and local law enforcement
agencies to investigate crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance
fraud and other illegal activity. 											
In 	2010, 	the 	Special 	Agents 	conducted 	100 	motor 	vehicle 	theft 	investigations,

equipment 	with 	a 	combined 	value 	of 	$1,480,606. 		They 	also 	conducted 	46
vehicle 	ID 	verifications 	for 	other 	federal, 	state, 	and 	local 		law 	enforcement
agencies. 															
Auto 	Theft 	Agents 	coordinate 	monthly 	regional 	meetings 		with 	other 	auto 	theft
investigators 	and 	insurance 	company 	special 	investigative 		units 		across 	the
Commonwealth 	of 	Virginia. 	These 		meetings 	are 	held 	to 	discuss 	current
automobile theft trends and coordinate enforcement efforts among agencies. 	In
addition, 		members 	of 	the 	unit 	provide 	auto 	theft 	investigation 		training 	to
numerous 	Troopers 	and 	local 	law-enforcement 	officers 	at 	the 	Virginia 	State
Police Academy and at regional training academies. 							
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – This is an insurance industry-funded
program 		established 	in 	1992 	by 	Section 	38.2-414 	of 	the 	Code 		of 	Virginia 	to
receive auto theft related tips and to provide cash rewards to the callers. 	The
H.E.A.T. 		Program 	also 	provides 	leadership 	and 	assistance 	to 	more 	than 	175
state 	and 	local 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	throughout 	Virginia 		by 	providing
training; 		conducting 	promotional 	events, 	prevention 	seminars 		and 	VIN 	Etching
events; offering grant funding and procuring specialized equipment. 			
H.E.A.T. 		also 	conducts 	two 	basic 	and 	one 	advanced 	auto 	theft 	investigation
school for law enforcement annually. 	H.E.A.T., with the assistance of the Virginia
Crime Prevention Association, also presents instruction in auto theft prevention
to 	crime 	prevention 		specialists 	and 	Operation 	HEATWave 		Coordinators
numerous 	times 	throughout 	the 	year. 		To 	enhance 	Virginia’s 		auto 	theft
investigative abilities, the H.E.A.T. office provides training scholarships for local
auto 	theft 	investigators 	to 	receive 	specialized 	training 	conducted 	by 	the
International Association of Auto Theft Investigators. 							
The H.E.A.T. office coordinates the deployment of bait cars that are used in high
theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 		Mobile Data Hunter
vehicles have also been deployed throughout the state to locate stolen vehicles.
The 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 	works 	to 	increase 	the 	public’s 	awareness 	about 	the
problem of auto theft, auto theft prevention devices and strategies by using a
variety of marketing strategies, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-HEAT) and cash
rewards. 		Citizens 		are 	directed 	to 	the 	H.E.A.T. 		Web 		Site 	at:
www.HeatReward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information. 		The public
is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they have any auto theft related
information.

Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted
in a momentous reduction in Virginia’s 	auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s
motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined by approximately
34 percent. 															
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – In 1999, the General Assembly approved
the establishment of an Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Bureau
of Criminal Investigation. The purpose of the program is to: 					
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when
	the Department has reason to believe that insurance fraud may have been or
	is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to determine the extent
	of such insurance fraud; 											
2. 	Respond to notifications or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by
	federal, 	state 	and 		local 	police, 	other 	law-enforcement 	authorities,
	governmental agencies or Units, and any other person; 					
3. 	Review 	notices 	and 		reports 	of 	insurance 	fraud; 	select 	the 	incidents 	of
	suspected 	fraud 	that, 	in 	its 	judgment, 	require 	further 	detailed 	investigation;
	and conduct the investigations. 										
Recent 	examples 	of 	insurance 	fraud 	include 	faking 	auto 	crashes, 	staging
burglaries, 	fraudulently 	reporting 	theft, 	and 	falsifying 	Workers’ 	Compensation
injuries. 	The IFP is constantly uncovering some newly developed “scam” aimed
at fraudulently receiving claim funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has
a significant economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of
claimed 	loss 	that 	was 	actually 	received 	by 	individuals 	submitting 	suspected
insurance 	fraud 	claims. 		During 	2010, 	more 	than 	$3.5 	million 	was 	actually
collected 	by 	individuals 		suspected 	of 	insurance 	fraud 	and 	the 	total 	amount
involved 	in 	suspicious 	claims 	that 	was 	attempted, 	but 	not 	collected, 	was 	over
$11.8 million. 															
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household
approximately $200 in additional insurance premiums annually and as much as
$1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services. 	This Program is dedicated
to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens
of 	Virginia 	and 	raising 	public 	awareness 	of 	insurance 	fraud. 		This 	is
accomplished 	through 	a 	toll-free 	hotline, 	1-877-62FRAUD 	(1-877-623-7283),
which citizens can call with information about suspected insurance fraud, as well
as 	a 	web 	site, 	www.StampOutFraud.com, 	which 	is 	available 	for 	reporting
suspected insurance fraud. 											
A reward program has been established to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for
individuals having a Sharp Eye and reporting information leading to the arrest
																	29

Table: 30
and/or 	conviction 	of 	individuals 	committing 	insurance 		fraud. 	In 	2010, 	the
Insurance Fraud Program paid out $3,000 in rewards. 		Since its inception, the
program has paid out over $76,000 to those individuals that have a “Sharp Eye”
and reported insurance fraud. 											
During 	2010, 	2,095 	notifications 	of 	potential 	property 	and 	casualty 	insurance
fraud were received from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and
the 	general 	public. 	There 		were 	425 	criminal 	investigations 	initiated 	by 	the
Special Agents and 156 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. 	One
hundred thirty-two fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered
restitution of $181,252 during 2010. 											
Drug Enforcement Section (DES) 									
DES 	continues 	in 	its 	aggressive 		enforcement 	of 	Virginia’s 	narcotics 	and
substance abuse laws. The Section remains committed to its support of local law
enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. 	Seven DES regional
field offices also help in this effort by supporting special operations initiated by
other law enforcement entities. 											
The 	DES 	mission 	is 	accomplished 		through 	the 	efforts 	of 	sworn 	members 	and
civilian support personnel in six distinct functional areas: 						
• DES Regional Field Offices 												
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 											
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 											
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 								
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 													
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 											
In 	2010, 	DES 	field 	offices 	participated 	in 	1,736 	investigations 	that 	yielded
$95,277,738 in seized narcotics, $1,091,287 in seized currency, and 305 persons
arrested 	on 	496 	felony 	and 	misdemeanor 	charges. 	In 	addition, 	774 	persons
were arrested on 1,264 felony and misdemeanor charges in cases where DES
assisted 	other 	agencies. 	Special 		Agents 	also 	seized 	23 	vehicles 	and 	115
weapons. 	Additionally, 39 actual meth labs were dismantled. 					
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – During 2010, DES participated in 28 state
and 	local 	multi-jurisdictional 		task 	forces, 	encompassing 		115 	local 	jurisdictions.
These 	multi-jurisdictional 	task 	forces 	participated 	in 	5,260 		investigations 	that
accounted 	for 	$30,597,385 		in 	illicit 	drug 	seizures, 	$6,657,944 	in 	seized 	U.S.
currency, and 3,361 persons arrested on 5,134 charges. 		These task forces also
seized 135 vehicles and 562 weapons. 									
Marijuana 	Eradication 	Program 		– 	The 	Commonwealth 		remains 		a 	prime
location for the cultivation of the marijuana plant. 	Virginia’s domestically grown
																	30
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 31 of 47”
Table: 31
marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop. 	With DEA funding, the
Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local law
enforcement agencies, and the Virginia Army National Guard Reconnaissance
Air 	Interdiction 	Detachment 	(RAID), 		conducted 	a 	regular 	program 	to 	eradicate
domestically-grown 	marijuana. 		In 	2010, 	the 	State 	Police 	and 		local 	law
enforcement agencies found 42,350 plants in 312 outdoor plots. 	There were also
5,103 marijuana plants eradicated in 116 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication
operations resulted in 389 arrests. 		Seizures included 334 weapons, vehicles,
and other personal property valued at $1,103,673. 		Considering the estimated
yield of consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not
reaching the streets as a result of eradication would be in excess of $142 million.
Governor’s 	Initiative 	Against 	Narcotics 	Trafficking 	(GIANT) 	– 	The 	GIANT
mission is to facilitate and assure coordination and cooperation among member
agencies. 	The five facets of the GIANT mission are: 						
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both
	indoor 	and 	outdoor, 	with 	the 	eradication 	of 	this 	marijuana 	and 	successful
	prosecution of the growers as a primary goal; 							
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts
	to monitor suspicious activities of all known airports in the Commonwealth,
	and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 				
3. 	Reducing the supply of illegal drugs entering and being transported within the
	Commonwealth by interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway;
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns
	in 	communication 	among 	the 	various 	state 	agencies 	and 	law 	enforcement
	authorities, and; 												
5. 	Utilizing 	the 	resources 	of 	county 		and 	city 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	to 	the
	maximum extent possible. 											
GIANT performed 438 operations during 2010 that resulted in 292 arrests, and
the 	seizure 	of 	$101,400,195 	worth 	of 	narcotics. 		GIANT 	also 	netted 	253
weapons, 17 vehicles, and $472,617 in U.S. currency. 					
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion agents
work with the DEA, the Department of Health Professions, and the Department of
Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies to eliminate
the diversion of prescription drugs for illicit purposes. 						
During 	2010, 	Drug 	Diversion 	received 	777 	complaints 	of 	diversion 	activities
throughout 	the 	Commonwealth. 	In 	response 	to 	these 	complaints, 	1,505
investigations 	were 	initiated. 	A 	total 	of 	534 	persons 	were 	arrested 	on 	940
															31
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 32 of 47”
Table: 32
charges. 	Additionally, 	seven 	search 		warrants 	were 	executed 	during 	the 	past
year. 																		
A 	major 	educational 	role 	of 	Drug 	Diversion 	is 	teaching 	local 	law 	enforcement
officials about the extent of the drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions
and what they can do about it. 	This role also included educating health care
professionals, 	both 	physicians 		and 	pharmacists, 		about 	the 	magnitude 	of 	the
problem 	and 	the 	importance 	of 	self-policing 	and 	ensuring 	the 	integrity 	of 	their
individual 	health 	care 	delivery 	systems. 	During 	2010, 	six 	presentations 	were
conducted 	for 	179 	healthcare 		professionals. 	The 	Drug 	Diversion 	Unit, 	with
assistance 	from 	the 	Department 	of 	Health 	Professions 		and 	the 		National
Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (N.A.D.D.I.), hosted the Tenth Annual
Drug Diversion School in Norfolk, Virginia. 									
Criminal Intelligence Division 										
The 	primary 		purpose 	of 	the 	Criminal 		Intelligence 	Division 	(CID) 	is 	to 	identify,
document, and disseminate criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in
organized crime or terrorism. 	CID is currently composed of three units; the Field
Intelligence Unit, the Virginia Fusion Center and the Joint Terrorism Task Force
or “JTTF”. 																	
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide
to collect and supply intelligence, including information on current investigations.
The unit also uses the Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The
unit 	is 	active 	in 	each 	of 	the 	Department’s 	seven 	field 	divisions. 		The 	Field
Intelligence Unit also has five agents assigned to the various FBI Joint Terrorism
Task Forces. 																
In 	2010, 	the 	Department 	was 	instrumental 	in 	securing 	the 	participation 	of 	the
Department of Corrections (DOC) in the Washington-Baltimore HIDTA GangNet
Intelligence System initiative. 	This multi-state regional system continues to be
populated 	with 	gang 	related 		information 	by 	law 	enforcement 	agencies 	in
Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia. 	Additional states on the east coats are
expected to join GangNet in the near future. 									
The 	Virginia 	Fusion 	Center 		(VFC) 	gathers, 	analyzes 	and 	disseminates
information 	and 	intelligence 	as 	it 	relates 	to 	all 	criminal 	activity 		to 	include
terrorism. 	This joint operation between the Virginia State Police and the Virginia
Department 		of 	Emergency 	Management 	is 	the 	first 	of 	its 	kind 	in 	the
Commonwealth. 	Its primary mission is to “fuse” together resources from local,
state 	and 	federal 	agencies 	and 		private 	industries 	to 	facilitate 		information
collection, analysis and sharing, in order to prevent or deter criminal activity. 	Its
secondary mission is to support the co-located Virginia Emergency Operations
Center by centralizing information and resources to provide a coordinated and
effective response in the event of an attack or natural disaster. 					
																		32
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 33 of 47”
Table: 33
The 	VFC 	operates 	the 	Terrorism 		Hotline 	and 	the 	Drug 	Hotline 	which 	are
initiatives 		that 	provide 	a 	conduit 	for 	the 	public 	to 	provide 	information 		on 	both
terrorist 	and 	criminal 	activities. 	The 	Homeland 	Security 	Information 	Network,
Virginia Portal (HSIN-VA) allows for public and private entities that have a need
and right to access certain databases a method of retrieving common operating
picture 	information. 		The 	VFC’s 		Critical 	infrastructure/Key 	Resource 	(CI/KR)
program 		is 	not 	only 		cataloging 	important 	infrastructure 	throughout 	the
Commonwealth, but is providing training to state and local first responders on
crime prevention and target hardening for sites in their jurisdictions. 	The Fusion
Liaison 	Officer 	(FLO) 	program 	is 	training 	first 	responders 	in 	what 	suspicious
activities could be precursors to criminal or terrorist activity and how to report the
information to the VFC. 														
High Tech Crimes Division 											
The High-Tech Crimes Division (HTCD) was created August 1, 2009, in an effort
to consolidate the agency’s multiple cyber initiatives under a single command,
and enhance the agency’s capacity to conduct cyber-crime investigations, digital
forensic analysis, and child exploitation/pornography investigations. 			
This endeavor incorporates High-Tech Crimes Agents from each geographical
field 	division, 	the 		Computer 	Evidence 	Recovery 		Section, 	the 	Northern
Virginia/District 	of 	Columbia 	Internet 	Crimes 	Against 	Children 	Task 	Force
(NOVA-DC ICAC), and the Technical Support Section. 						
High-Tech Crimes and NOVA-DC ICAC: 								
The 	personnel 	assigned 	to 	these 	sections 	have 	conducted 	numerous 	cyber-
crime 	investigations, 	and 		assisted 	local, 	state, 	federal, 	and 	international 	law
enforcement 	personnel 		in 	combating 	these 	complex 	crimes. 	In 	addition, 	the
year-to-date measures reflect that personnel in this section are responsible for
providing 		training 	to 	8,967 	law 	enforcement 	officers 	and 	citizens, 	making 	144
arrests involving child pornography and child exploitation, conducting 172 digital
forensic examinations, and processing 351 CyberTips received from the National
Center for Exploited and Missing Children (NCMEC). 						
Computer Evidence Recovery Section: 								
The 	personnel 	in 	this 	section 	are 	specially 	trained 	to 	conduct 	comprehensive
digital 	forensic 	analysis 	for 	all 	cyber-related 	criminal 	activity. 		The 	section
provides 	digital 	forensic 	analysis 		to 	local, 	state, 	and 		federal 	law 	enforcement
personnel, as well as providing expert court testimony. 	Year-to-date measures
reflect 	that 	the 	section 	provided 	134 	hours 	of 	training, 	examined 	206 	devices
containing 	42,138 	gigabytes 	of 		data, 	completed 	252 	digital 	previews, 	and
handled 68 separate requests for service.

Technical Support Unit: 											
The personnel in this section provide technical and surveillance support to local,
state, 	and 	federal 	law 	enforcement. 	The 	year-to-date 	measures 	reflect 	the
section 	has 	provided 	870 	hours 	of 	training, 	handled 	148 	cases, 	and 	1,607
requests for service including 31 hostage/barricaded subject incidents, and 77
requests for courtroom closed-circuit audio/video systems in child victim cases.
The complex and covert nature of this special group has been instrumental in the
successful 	investigation 	and 	prosecution 	of 	numerous 	criminal 	matters 	and 	is
absolutely essential to the continued success of the Department’s mission. 		
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 					
CCI was established in 2003 to interdict narcotics on Virginia’s highways, public
transportation 	systems, 	schools 	and 	businesses. 	Additionally, 	CCI 	provides
seven regional response teams to address chemical, nuclear and bio-terrorism
events. 	In 	2005, 	the 	mission 	of 	CCI 	evolved 	to 	incorporate 	a 	new 	strategic
initiative developed to diminish the violence associated with gang-related crimes.

		BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 				
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of 	
over 64,000 miles of state roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	
Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic enforcement and criminal 	
law 	enforcement 	as 	the 	need 	arises 	and 	based 	upon 	the 	ability 	of 	local 	law
enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor 	
Vehicle Safety Inspection Program regarding the enforcement of motor carrier 	
and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the Aviation Unit that provides 	
aerial 	support 	for 	law 	enforcement 	activities 	and 	emergency 	medical 	
evacuations. 													
The 	Commonwealth's 	geography 	and 	size 	dictate 	the 	need 	to 	decentralize 	
uniformed police services into seven field divisions. These divisions are further 	
subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or more cities and/or 	
counties. 	Staffing 	is 	allocated 		based 	upon 	workload 	demands 	at 	the 	city 	and
county level. 													
Enforcement 	Initiatives 	to 	Enhance 	Highway 	Safety 	and 		
Public Safety 													
Checkpoint Strikeforce 												
Identifying 	and 	removing 	drunk 		drivers 	from 	the 	highways 	of 	the 		
Commonwealth 	of 	Virginia 	is 	a 	primary 	objective 	of 	State 	Police 		
Troopers in their goal to provide the safest highway system in our nation. 		
Checkpoint Strikeforce is a high visibility DUI enforcement campaign that 		
involves saturation patrols and DUI sobriety checkpoints every week on 		
specific highways and in locations where alcohol related incidents and arrests 	
have 	been 	identified. 	This 	national 	campaign 	is 	supported 	by 	the 	National 	
Highway 	Traffic 	Safety 	Administration 	(NHTSA) 	and 	involves 	significant 	public 	
education and awareness, and strict DUI enforcement.

During 	2010, 	a 	total 	of 	18,815 	vehicles 		passed 	through 	10 	DUI 	sobriety
checkpoints 	resulting 	in 	16 	drunk 	driving 	arrests. 	Additionally, 	DUI 	saturation
patrols 	were 	conducted 	on 	Interstates, 		primary 	and 	secondary 	highways
throughout 	Virginia 	resulting 	in 	arrest 	and 	the 	removal 	280 	alcohol 		impaired
drivers. 																
Operation Air, Land, and Speed 										
In response to an increase in fatal crashes the Virginia State Police created and
implemented 	an 	enforcement 	plan 	in 	July, 	2006, 	to 	effectively 	reduce 	and
eliminate vehicle crashes on the highway attributed to traffic violations. The effort
was also intended to combat the increase in citizen complaints of poor driving
behavior 	on 	Interstates 	that 	pass 	through 	Virginia 	to 	make 	travel 	in 	our
Commonwealth safe and enjoyable for motorists. 							
With the success of this program, six enforcement phases were conducted in

Click-it-or-Ticket 													
Increasing the usage rate of vehicle safety belts and child safety seats are the
primary 	functions 	of 	this 	national 	and 	statewide 	initiative. 	Virginia 	has 	seen 	a
steady average increase in safety belt use over the past decade from 67.1 % in
1997, 	to 	80.5 	% 	recorded 	in 	2010, 	which 	is 	the 	second 	consecutive 	year 	for
Virginia with a usage rate above eight percent. Click-it-or-Ticket combines public
awareness, education, and enforcement to gain compliance with existing safety
belt 	laws. 	Increasing 	the 	use 	of 	safety 	belts 	and 	child 	safety 	seats 	have
statistically shown to decrease deaths and serious injuries resulting from traffic
crashes. 															
During the May phase of Click-it-or-Ticket 	state police personnel issued 1,801
summonses for failure to wear safety belts and 479 summonses for child safety
restraint violations. 													
Smooth Operator 													
The Smooth Operator Program is a public safety initiative intended, which aims
to 	provide 	education, 	information 	and 	solutions 	for 	the 	problem 	of 	aggressive
driving. For more than 12 years, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have
partnered through the Smooth Operator Program to combat aggressive driving.
Law 	enforcement 	agencies, 		trauma 	experts, 	government 	officials 	and 	other
professionals 	have 	worked 	together 	to 	educate 	motorists 	of 	the 	risks 	involved
with 	aggressive 	driving, 	and 	to 	stigmatize 	aggressive 	driving 	behavior 	on 	our
roads. 																
Operation C.A.R.E. 												
Proactive 	enforcement 	efforts 	and 	increased 	police 	visibility 	during 	the 	major
holidays of Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving are
the primary purposes of the Combined Accident Reduction Effort (C.A.R.E.).

During these major holiday periods that are noted for increased highway travel,
the Department maximizes the deployment of all available resources to address
highway safety and promote travel safety throughout the Commonwealth. 		
Primary and Secondary Highway Emphasis 							
During 	2010, 		each 		of 	the 	department’s 	seven 		field 	divisions 	continued
enforcement emphasis and visibility on primary and secondary highways within
the 	counties 	in 	their 	divisions. 	Each 	division’s 	program 	focused 	resources 	on
those 	highways 	where 	crashes, 	traffic 	violations, 	and 	citizen 	complaints
regarding 	traffic 	were 	noted. 	The 	objectives 	of 	this 	initiative 	were 	to 	prevent
crashes, 	reduce 	violations, 	and 	address 	the 	concerns 	citizens 	identified 	as
threats to their safety. 													
Virginia State Fair 													
On 	September 		24, 	2010, 	the 	State 	Fair 	of 	Virginia 	welcomed 	visitors 	to 	“The
Meadow Event Park” in Caroline County. 								
The State Police is fully responsible for all safety and security duties associated
with the fair, its vendors, the exhibitors, entertainers, thousands of visitors and all
traffic management in and around the fair grounds. 						
During the eleven days of the annual event nearly 250,000 visitors attended the
fair 	to 	partake 		of 	the 	art 	and 	crafts, 	the 	competitions, 	the 	displays, 	and 	the
general festivities. Playing host to one-quarter of a million visitors places a high
demand on services and available resources. During the operational hours of the
fair 	troopers 	and 	supervisors 	responded 	to 	calls 	for 	service 	ranging 	in 	nature
from lost property, missing persons, medical emergencies, disabled vehicles and
suspicious activity, just name a few. 									
Safety Division 													
As of December 31, 2010, there were 4,400 active inspection stations located
throughout 	the 		Commonwealth 	of 	Virginia. 	There 	were 	14,777 	licensed 	safety
inspectors 	who 	performed 	approximately 	7,427,182 	inspections 	at 	appointed
stations 	during 	2010. 	Approximately 	22% 	(1,613,691 	vehicles) 	of 	all 	vehicles
submitted for inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 				
This Division investigated 2,641 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,395
instances 	of 	disciplinary 	action 	against 	217 	stations 	for 	various 	classes 	of
offenses and the suspension of 40 inspection stations. These statistics include
administrative 	errors 	made 	by 	inspection 	stations, 	and 	the 	majority 	of 	errors/
complaints were corrected by counseling sessions. 						
Disciplinary action was also taken against 722 safety inspectors, resulting in 158
suspensions. 															
Safety Division personnel also conducted 941 business security checks.

Motor Carrier Safety 												
Motor 	Carrier 	Safety 	teams 	ensure 	that 	trucks 	and 	buses 	meet 	all 	safety
requirements 	when 	operating 	on 	Virginia 	highways. 	Troopers 	assigned 	to 	the
Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and other
interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations.
They also serve as instructors in criminal justice training academies. 			
Motor 	Carrier 	Safety 	teams 	responded 	to 	21 	hazardous 	material 	spills 	or
incidents 	in 	2010 	and 	conducted 	173 	post-crash 	investigations 	of 	heavy
commercial vehicles involved in accidents. 								
Data indicates that during 2010, Troopers conducted 38,200 in-depth inspections
on heavy commercial vehicles and 7,119 of these, or 19 percent, were placed out
of 	service 	for 	violations 	of 	regulations 	governing 	safety 	equipment 		and
transportation of hazardous materials.

The BK117 and BO-105 are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. 	
Medical Evacuation 															
The Department operates two helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve
Central 		and 	Southwest 	Virginia. 	These 	programs 	provide 	rapid 	response,
advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically injured patients to a
level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the
citizens residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on
April 	1, 	1984, 	and 	responds 	to 	calls 	for 	assistance 	in 	a 	60-mile 	radius 	of
Richmond, 	Virginia. 	Med-Flight 	II 	began 	operations 	on 	January 	1, 	1987 	and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-
Flight 	III 	began 	operations 		on 	September 	1, 	2000, 	and 	responds 	to 	calls 	for
assistance predominately along the Lynchburg-Route 29 corridor to Danville and
in 	a 	60-mile 	radius 	of 	Lynchburg. 	Effective 	April 	30, 	2010 	the 	Med-Flight 	III
program closed, it is now used only for law enforcement operations. In 2010, all 3
programs responded to a total of 2,519 requests with 876 patients transported.
The total number of flights for all three programs from April 1, 1984 to December
31, 2010 was 28,872 responses to calls with 17,223 patients transported as a
result of these calls. 																
Search and Rescue 															
During 	2010 	the 	Aviation 	Unit 	responded 	to 	531 	requests 	for 	searches 	for
escapees, missing persons, criminals, and stolen property. Utilizing a Forward
Looking 	Infra-Red 	system 		on 	four 	helicopters 	and 	a 	30 	million-candlepower
searchlight 	on 	the 	other 	helicopters, 	the 	Unit 	has 	been 	successful 	in 	locating
fugitives, missing persons, and lost children. 	During this period the Unit also
recovered $8,000 in stolen property, and 1 missing aircraft. 	As a result, 5 arrests
were made. 																	
Surveillance 																	
The Aviation Unit also conducts surveillance using our aircraft. In 2010, the Unit
was 	requested 	7 	times 	for 	drug 	or 	narcotic 	surveillance, 	13 	times 	for 	other
criminal matters and 39 miscellaneous calls. As a result, 2,531 marijuana plants

Motorist Assistance Program 												
The Motorist Assistance Program operated by the department currently operates
in the four largest metropolitan areas in Virginia with operations in Chesapeake,
Fairfax, Richmond, and in the Roanoke/Salem areas. 								
During 	2010, 	motorist 		assistance 	aides 	provided 	assistance 	to 	disabled 	or
stranded motorist on more than 48,997 occasions. 									
State Police motorist assistance aides provided services such as fixing flat tires,
providing 	gasoline, 	jump-starting 	vehicles, 	traffic 		control, 	and 	making 	cellular
phone calls for additional assistance or to notify family members of a stranded
motorist's 	situation. 	Motorist 	Assistance 	Aides 	also 		were 	instrumental 	in 	the
arrest 	of 	drunk 	drivers 	and 	aggressive 	drivers 	by 	reporting 	erratic 		driving
behavior to troopers who subsequently made the apprehension. 					
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 										
The 	Department 	has 	55 	Commercial 	Vehicle 	Enforcement 	Officers 		whose
primary responsibilities include the inspection and measurement of commercial
vehicles 	that 	utilize 	the 	highways 	of 	the 	Commonwealth. 	During 	2010,
approximately 	18 	million 	commercial 	vehicles 	passed 	through 	Virginia's 	13
permanent 	weigh 	stations 	for 	inspection. 	Through 		the 	inspection 	of 	these
vehicles 	and 	through 		other 	enforcement 		initiatives, 	Commercial 	Vehicle
Enforcement Officers issued 45,411 summonses and made 126 criminal arrests.
This 	program 	is 	vital 	to 	Virginia's 	overall 	highway 	safety 	program 	through 	the
protection 		of 	roadways 	from 	overweight 	and 		oversized 	vehicles; 	through
assurances 	that 		commercial 	vehicles 	are 	mechanically 	safe 	to 	operate 		on 	the
highways; 	and 	through 		the 	validation 	of 	all 	commercial 	vehicle 	operators 	to
ensure 	they 	are 	properly 	licensed 	to 	operate 	a 	commercial 	vehicles 	in 	the
Commonwealth. 																
Crime Prevention 														
During 	2010, 	the 	Department 	provided 	specialized 	training 	to 	the 		Crime
Prevention 	Specialist 	troopers 	on 	current 	crime 	prevention 		trends 		and
techniques. 	Participating 	troopers 	received 	training 	to 	enhance 	their 	ability 	in
protecting governmental, business, and residential security through the "Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPTED) model and other mitigation
based methodologies. Additional training focused on personal safety, workplace
violence prevention and personal information associated crimes. All training was
part 	of 	an 	intensified 	crime 	prevention 	curriculum 	that 	enabled 	troopers 	to
achieve 	certification 	or 		remain 	certified 	through 		the 	Department 	of 	Criminal
Justice Services as Crime Prevention Specialist.
