sworn 	employees. 	The 	Bureau 	includes 	the 	Divisions 	of 	Communications, 	Criminal 	Justice 	Information
Services, 	Information 	Technology 	and 	Planning 	Division, 	Personnel, 	Property 	and 	Finance, 	Statewide
Agencies Radio System, Sworn Programs and Training. 							
Employees in these areas provide the Department, especially troopers and special agents in the field, with
essential services through their extensive technical and professional expertise. 	These services range from: 	
• 	Purchasing and configuring personal computers ... to designing complex and sophisticated computerized
	systems to maintain critical criminal files; 									
• 	Installing police radios and radar units in patrol vehicles ... to designing and implementing a Computer-
	Aided Dispatch System;

The Bureau also develops and proposes legislation involving traffic safety and criminal statutes, and serves as
liaison during General Assembly sessions for discussion of issues. 					
Communications Division 											
The 	Communications 	Division 	is 	responsible 	for 	the 	proper 	installation, 	operation, 	and 	maintenance 	of
telephone, land mobile radio, and microwave radios assigned to the Communications Division. 	Under the
command of the Communications Officer, the Division designs, installs, operates and maintains land mobile
radios, microwave radios and private telephone networks. 	The system includes 87 microwave radio sites, 46
of which also have land mobile radio base stations. 	This responsibility includes compliance with requirements
of 	the 	Federal 	Communications 	Commission 	(FCC), 	the 	Federal 	Aviation 	Administration 	(FAA) 	and 	the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 										
The Division is staffed by 64 persons, divided into 12 teams. The teams are responsible for: 			
• 	Maintaining mobile radios; 												
• 	Maintaining radar and portable radios; 										
• 	Maintaining mobile computer terminals; 										
								2 							
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 3 of 29”
Table: 3
• 	Provision of pager, cellular, and wireless data equipment and services; 							
• 	Installing, repairing and maintaining radio towers, obstruction lighting, antennas and emergency power
	plants; 																	
• 	Installing field communications equipment at remote sites and area offices; 						
• 	Installing 	and 	maintaining 	equipment, 	telephones, 	and 	other 	telecommunications 	at 	Administrative
	Headquarters; and 															
• 	Deploying one maintenance team at each field division for mobile and fixed communications equipment.
Work continues on the microwave communications system upgrade. 	Of the 23 sites considered to be the
backbone of the microwave system, 19 have been converted to digital service. 	Digital microwave equipment
has been procured to provide service to the last two headquarters locations, and to the Eastern Shore. 	These
six sites are nearly complete and will be in operation to Division IV and VII and the Eastern Shore by late
summer. 	Site leases have been executed and microwave site development is progressing to provide that
service. 	Cooperative development or collocation agreements continue to fund equipment upgrades from
analog 	to 	digital 	microwave 	systems. 	These 	collocation 	and 	relocation 	agreements 	have 	saved 	the
Department approximately $8.5 million over the past seven years. 							
The Division is supporting efforts of the Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program team to define
the existing network and review plans for the new upgraded State Police Land Mobile Radio Network that will
serve all of the Commonwealth’s state-level public safety agencies. 							
The Division has procured and installed almost 400 mobile computer terminals (MCT) and wireless modems to
be used for messaging and routine checks of drivers’ licenses and vehicle registrations. Currently, new
generation mobile services are being investigated to provide higher capacity and better coverage to a larger
geographic area. 	Additionally, some troopers in the Roanoke area have been equipped with MCTs through a
partnership with the City of Roanoke. 												
Telephone systems and cabling have been replaced at Administrative Headquarters with new copper and fiber
optic service. 	Telephone system upgrades continue as needed at area offices and division headquarters
statewide. 																	
In addition to mission critical communications, the Communications Division coordinates and supports wireless
communications equipment and services from public networks. 	These services make Department personnel
more accessible and keep them better informed regarding routine and administrative activities. 	The number of
wireless telephones approved and in use has doubled in the past year, and now approaches 1,000 units. 	
The Division continues to provide communications support with temporary systems for special events as they
occur. 	Such activities include communications to support security for visiting dignitaries, as well as routine
events where large groups of spectators gather over short periods of time. 							
All 	field 	Division 	radio 	shops 	are 	certified 	as 	independent 	laboratories 	by 	The 	Division 	of 	Consolidated
Laboratories for the purposes of calibrating radar tuning forks. 	In the past year, approximately 100 additional
RADAR units were procured and issued to expand availability and replace older units. 	The present inventory
of active radars is approximately 1,500 units. The majority of Department radars are the newer Eagle units. 	
The Division provides statewide telephone and local area network wiring requirements for the Department, as
well as other state agencies. At the present time, in excess of 5,000 items of equipment are being maintained
for 	six 	additional 	agencies. 	The 	Division 	also 	continues 	to 	maintain 	approximately 	9,000 	items 	of 	radio
equipment 	for 	most 	of 	the 	state’s 	public 	safety 	agencies. 	The 	Communications 	Division 	has 	actively
participated with the Capital Wireless Interoperability Network (CAPWIN) and SAFECOM (formerly PSWN)
activities to improve interoperability in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C., area.

Criminal Justice Information Services Division 							
The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is responsible for the maintenance of all files within the
Department. 	This includes the implementation, monitoring, destruction, and archiving of records in accordance
with 	the 	State 	Police 	Records 	Retention 	Schedule. 	The 	Division 	processed 	and 	responded 	to 	1,844
subpoenas and 119 Freedom of Information Act requests in 2004. 							
Central Criminal Records Exchange (CCRE) 								
The Criminal Investigative Reports Section received and processed 21,804 investigative reports in 2004.
CCRE automated 1,614 non-computerized criminal records in calendar year 2004, leaving a total of 155,475
misdemeanor microfiche records to be automated. 								
The Supreme Court/State Police Disposition Interface 								
The Interface consists of 116 Circuit Courts, 129 General District Courts and 124 Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Courts transmitting court dispositions to CCRE. 	In 2004, 364,123 records were transmitted, negating
the requirement to submit the SP-180/SP-222 hardcopy disposition forms to CCRE. 	Of 	all dispositions
transmitted, 66,610 or 18.3% were rejected. 	In February 2000, the arrest/disposition monitoring system was
implemented. 	Designed to reduce human intervention, notifications are automatically generated for missing
arrest fingerprint cards. 	For 2004, notifications for 26,377 individual charges were generated. 	The majority of
notifications (94%) were generated because the court did/could not include the Document Control Number
when transmitting their data. 	The remaining notifications (6%) were generated when the court transmitted the
Document Control Number, but CCRE did not have a corresponding fingerprint card on file. 			
Non-Criminal Justice Name-Search Program (NCSI) 								
The program continues to experience growth, with 363,508 inquiries processed in 2004. 	Due to this growth,
the Non-Criminal Justice Interface (NCJI) was implemented on February 8, 1996, to effectively address this
demand. 	The NCJI can be accessed through the Department’s web site. 	The NCJI eliminates the requirement
for CCRE staff to receive and process “paper record name-search requests.” 	As of December 31, 2004, there
were 167,283 electronic name-search transmissions received from participants, with an average response time
of 72-hours or less since implementation. 	This method of automation tremendously enhanced customer
service. 													
Mental Health File 											
These records are maintained for the purpose of denying individuals on file the ability to purchase a firearm(s).
Official notifications of individuals in these categories are received from clerks of courts upon court adjudication
of an individual being incompetent, involuntarily committed or mentally incapacitated. 	As of December 31,
2004, there were 8,329 mental health records added, bringing the total records on file to 62,849. 		
Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry (SOR) 							
The Sex Offender Registry (SOR) includes 13,094 fingerprint-based registrations received since July 1, 1997.
The Registry is designed to protect the general public, and children in particular, by providing personal
descriptive 	and 	sentencing 	information 	on 	individuals 	convicted 	of 	certain 	sex 	crimes. 	Photographs 	of
offenders are available, and violent offender registrations are maintained on the Internet. 	There were 137,553
searches conducted against the Registry for employment-licensure purposes in 2004. 	During 2004, the SOR
verified the address of 22,819 sex offenders, and initiated 5,567 criminal investigations to the field divisions. 	
The Correctional Status Information (CSI) Interface 								
As of December 31, 2004, there were 162,500 offenders on file with commitments received from the Virginia
Department of Corrections, which accounts for 11.74% of the offenders on file. 	The Central Criminal Records
Exchange continues to receive Correctional Status Information on a weekly basis. 	The Correctional Status
Information Interface improved the criminal history information by providing up-to-date correctional information
with minimal error. 											
The Microfilm Section 											
This section archived 1,512,567 documents during 2004.

Photographic Laboratory 													
The Photo Lab maintains records, files, film, and responds to requests for photographs, digital images, and
court enlargements. 	Additionally, 148,125 photographic prints, an increase of 3%, were developed for use by
sworn personnel in investigations and prosecution of motor vehicle crashes and criminal cases in 2004. 	
The Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) 								
This 	statewide 	computer 	system 	searches 	and 	stores 	rolled 	fingerprints 		and 	partial 	latent 	fingerprints
recovered 	from 	crime 	scenes. 	The 	central 	components 	of 	this 	system 	are 	located 	at 	State 	Police
Administrative Headquarters. 	The Department and 22 other state and local agencies have access to the
system 	through 	terminals 	located 	in 	their 	respective 	agencies. 	The 	newly 	acquired 	Global 	Transaction
Controller receives Live Scan transmissions and provides automated interfaces to CCH, SOR, CATS, and
AFIS systems for searching and updates. 		The installation of the Electronic Fingerprint Archive System has
enhanced our ability in the storage and retrieval of fingerprint records. 						
Currently, there are 1,576,414 ten-print fingerprint records in file and 75,438 unsolved latent fingerprints in the
database. 	In 2004, there were 2,825 suspects identified as a result of successful latent print searches on the
AFIS system. 														
The Department’s Live Scan network electronically captures and transmits arrest and fingerprint information to
the State Police and the FBI which enhanced the agencies ability to detect aliases and outstanding warrants
on arrestees prior to their release’. 												
Operational Live Scan Sites and Units 											
Currently, there are 96 Criminal Live Scan sites utilizing 128 Live Scan units. 	In addition, there are 50 civilian
applicant Live Scan sites utilizing 66 Live Scan Units. 	A total of 34 criminal Live Scan sites are submitting
criminal justice and concealed weapon applicant information via Live Scan. 						
The following is a brief comparison of statistics. The percentages reflect the increase or decrease in 2004.
			CATEGORY 				% of CHANGE 						
	1. Arrest records processed 					-1% 						
	2. Arrest records via Live Scan 				+0.3% 						
	3. Applicants processed 					+15%

	8. Applicant Live Scan units 					+64% 						
	9. Criminal Live Scan sites submitting 		+59% 						
During 2004, the fingerprint section processed 213,333 criminal arrests, 142,184 applicants, and 2,274 sex
offender fingerprint cards. 													
Virginia Firearms Transaction Program (VFTP) 									
The VFTP provides for the approval at the point of sale for all firearms, except antiques, based on the results
of a criminal history record information check on the buyer. 	In 2004, 207,823 firearm transactions were
conducted, which is a 6% increase in transactions conducted during 2003. 	Of these, 2,348 (9% increase) were
disapproved, and 187 (16% increase) wanted persons were identified with 68 (5% reduction) arrests reported.
In 2004, as compared to 2003, the State Police requested 857 (1% reduction) criminal investigations related to
the illegal sale or attempt to purchase firearms, of which 634 (74%) were arrested. 				
							5 								
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 6 of 29”
Table: 6
Direct Access 																
Approximately 	28% 	of 	the 	statewide 	volume 	of 	VFTP 	criminal 	history 	record 	information 	checks 	were
processed via on-site terminals at the physical location of the participating Direct Access Program firearms
dealers. 	The State Police Firearms Transaction Center continues to enhance and expand direct access to the
VFTP. 	As on-line users increase, staff is diverted from telephonic firearm transactions to research and
verification processes. 	Additional employee time devoted to these other processes provide more efficient
overall services to the firearm dealers and purchasers. 							
Certificates for 173 (34% decrease) multiple handgun purchases were issued authorizing the purchase of more
than one handgun within any 30-day period. 	The reduction in the volume of certificates is attributed to the
2004 General Assembly’s amendment and re-enactment of Section 18.2-308.2:2, Code of Virginia, which
provides that a valid concealed handgun permit is an exemption to the handgun purchase restriction of that
section. 																	
A fingerprint-based criminal background check is performed for all employees of a gun dealer to transfer
firearms, and the State Police issues a seller identification number for qualified employees. 	In 2004, 1,099
(19% increase) seller identification numbers were issued. 							
Concealed Handgun Permits 												
Since July 1, 1995, 263,390 concealed handgun permits were issued as authorized by Section 18.2-308, Code
of Virginia; 27,166 of which were issued in 2004 (19% reduction) by Virginia Circuit Courts. 	As of July 1, 2004,
this Code section was amended to require State Police issuance of Nonresident Concealed Handgun Permits.
Between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2004, the State Police received 1,369 requests for nonresident
permit application packages and issued 387 nonresident permits. 							
Pursuant to statute, the State Police enters the permit holder’s name and description in the Virginia Criminal
Information Network (VCIN) so that the permit's existence and current status will be made known to law-
enforcement personnel accessing the Network for investigative purposes. 						
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 											
The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Section is responsible for collecting monthly Incident Based Reporting
(IBR) data from all contributing law enforcement agencies throughout the state on 46 different crime offenses.
During 2004, two additional agencies became certified for IBR submission, bringing the total IBR agencies to
273. 	These agencies represent 98% of the total UCR contributing agencies, and 99.9% of the total population
of Virginia. 	The UCR office no longer accepts summary hardcopy reports. 	Data is submitted either by diskette
or via the Internet. 	The diskettes are scanned, copied, and uploaded to the mainframe. 	The Internet files are
submitted through the IBR website. 	This is a secure system to which only contributing agencies have access.
Twice a week, the submitted files are run through the edit process, which generates an error report for the
agencies to correct any incidents that failed to be sent to the IBR central repository database. 	A monthly file of
Virginia’s data is generated and emailed to the FBI for inclusion in their annual publication, Crime in the United
States. 																	
During 2004, the UCR office assisted local agencies daily with IBR training issues, interpretation of error
reports and clarifications in offense definitions and reporting procedures, as well as assisted vendors with
reporting issues. 	There are 18 private vendors representing IBR certified agencies. 	Several large agencies
have built their own in-house software systems. 	Monthly and quarterly reports are now posted on the IBR
website 	rather 	than 	having 	to 	be 	mailed 	to 	each 	contributing 	agency. 	The 	UCR 	office 	responded 	to
approximately ten requests daily for crime statistics from state agencies, government officials, students, media,
and the general public. 														
Statistical crime data is published in the CJIS Newsletters, the annual report, Crime in Virginia, and distributed
to contributing agencies, Commonwealth’s Attorneys, judges, legislators, and other state agencies. 	The
annual report is available to the public for a nominal fee. 	The 2003 annual report was published in June 2004.
The Crime in Virginia report can also be found on the State Police website. 	This report contains reported
Group A offenses by each contributing agency in Virginia, and Group A and Group B arrests by counties and
										6

Table: 7
cities in Virginia. 	The data is used for law enforcement budget funding, inmate forecasting, and legislative
implementation. 												
The IBR website went into production in 2002. 	At the beginning of 2004, 211 agencies were submitting their
monthly data through the Internet. 	By the end of the year, 240 agencies had switched from mailing diskettes to
electronically sending files via the Internet. 	This site provides law enforcement agencies with the convenience
of on-line monthly data submission, receiving timely error notifications and monthly and year-to-date statistical
reports, performing searches and ad hoc reporting, viewing manuals and bulletins, and posting inquiries in the
FAQ section. 												
During 2004, fortunately, there were no law enforcement officers in Virginia who were feloniously killed while
performing their duties. 	In 2003, there had been a record high number of six officers killed. 	In the broad
category of offenses reported in this system, Crimes Against a Person, Crimes Against Property, and Crimes
Against Society, both Crimes Against Persons and Crimes Against Society increased over 2003. 	The crimes
against 	persons 	that 	increased 	were 	kidnapping/abduction, 	assaults 	and 	non-forcible 	sex 	offenses.
Kidnapping offenses increased by 19%, assault offenses increased by 5%, and non-forcible sex offenses
increased by 17%. 	Each of the offenses in the society crimes increased except gambling. 	Drug offenses
increased 8%, pornography/obscene material increased 12%, prostitution increased 11% and weapon law
violations increased 3%. 		Only murder and forcible sex offenses decreased in the Crimes Against a person
category in 2004. 	There were 392 murders reported in 2004 compared to 408 in 2003, a decrease of 3.9%.
Several of the property crimes increased; however, they were lesser crimes in number than the major of
property 	crimes 	such 	as 	burglaries, 	larcenies, 	and 	motor 	vehicle 	thefts. 	The 	property 	crimes 	showing
increases 	were 	robbery, 		arson, 	bribery, 	counterfeiting/forgery, 	fraud, 	embezzlement, 	and 	stolen 	property
offenses. 													
Total arrests for the year of 2004 were up 7% from arrests reported in 2003. 	Adult arrests increased 6.5% and
juvenile arrests increased 10.3%. 	There was an increase in all adult arrests except for the offenses of forcible
sex offenses, arson, extortion/blackmail, gambling offenses, bribery, and weapon law violations. 	Juvenile
arrests were up, as well, in all categories of crimes except for the offenses of murder, forcible sex offenses,
arson, burglary, counterfeiting/forgery, drug/narcotics offenses, gambling offenses, and bribery. 		
Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) / National Crime Information Center (NCIC) 		
The VCIN/NCIC system now serves 672 member agencies with 6,503 terminals (an increase of 196 terminals
over the number of terminals in 2003). 	Of these terminals, 2,690 are non-mobile; a 3% increase over 2003,
and 3,813 terminals are mobile; an increase of 4% from 2003. 	In 2004, VCIN processed approximately
273,300,020 transactions, an increase of 14% over 2003 totals, between NCIC/NLETS member agencies and
state computer databases. 	This system processes messages and/or transactions in approximately three
seconds. 													
Virginia agencies entered numerous types of information in the VCIN/NCIC system, which is critical to law
enforcement officers. 	As an example, these systems stored information relating to wanted persons, missing
persons, and stolen vehicles. 	VCIN/NCIC currently retains Virginia information relating to 45,565 wanted
persons, 913 missing persons, and 12,307 stolen vehicles. 						
Information Technology and Planning Division 						
Planning and Research Section 									
The Planning and Research Section provides planning and policy support to all divisions and units of the
Department and is responsible for: 									
• 	Conducting evaluations of new equipment, procedures, 	technologies and; 				
• 	Updating staffing formulas; 										
• 	Coordinating the Department’s accreditation and grants management programs and the Mandates on
	Local Government; 											
• 	Conducting evaluations of existing programs and policies; 						
							7 						
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 8 of 29”
Table: 8
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s performance measures; 						
• 	Providing support in the development of grant applications and budgetary submissions; 			
• 	Conducting legislative studies mandated by the General Assembly; 						
• 	Developing and monitoring the Department’s Strategic Plan; 							
• 	Conducting employee surveys to assess progress in meeting goals in the Department’s Strategic Plan 		
• 	Maintaining departmental manuals; 											
• 	Preparing the annual Use of Force Report; 										
• 	Conducting the annual citizen survey; 											
During 2004, the Unit also administered 21 grants that provided approximately $32.6 million in funding for
agency projects. 															
Accreditation 															
The 	purpose 	of 	the 	accreditation 	process 	is 	to 	improve 	the 	delivery 	of 	law 	enforcement 	services 	by
demonstrating that an agency’s operations are in compliance with generally accepted standards. 	Accreditation
requires 	a 	comprehensive 	review 	of 	every 	aspect 	of 	the 	Department’s 	organization, 	operations, 	and
administration. 															
In 1986, the Virginia State Police became the second state law enforcement agency in the nation to be
accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), Inc. In 1991, 1996,
2001, and again in 2004, the Department achieved reaccreditation following an on-site inspection and review
by CALEA assessors of the agency’s policies, procedures, and operations. 	Maintaining accredited status is an
on-going project for all accredited law enforcement agencies and requires constant monitoring and periodic
updating of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with internationally accepted law enforcement
accreditation 	standards. 	In 	December 	2004, 	the 	Department 	was 	one 	of 	eleven 	agencies 	awarded 	a
Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation for successfully maintaining accredited status for over 15 years. 		
Information Technology Section 												
The Information Technology Section operates one of the largest computer centers in state government.
Requirements for law enforcement applications are addressed by equipment and software provided by IBM,
NEC 	Corporation, 	UNISYS 	Corporation 	and 	SUN 	Micro 	Systems. 	The 	section 	operates 	two 	separate
computer rooms 24 hours a day. 												
Automated Fingerprint Processing 											
In 2004, the Live Scan Network was expanded to 150 systems in 117 local agencies. 	Thirty-two of these sites
are applicant agencies, the rest are local booking agencies. 	More than 213,000 arrest fingerprints were
electronically transmitted to State Police in 2004 from local agencies. This represents 83% of the arrest volume
in Virginia. 	Approximately 50% of the arrests received electronically at State Police were processed without
human intervention. 													
In 2004, over 142,000 applicant prints were processed through the automated applicant system, which reduces
the turnaround time from months to days. 	Thirty-five percent of these applicant requests were initiated at Live
Scan devices and were processed with minimal human intervention. 						
Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) / Management Information System (MIS) Section 			
The Virginia State Police Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system allows for rapid entry and retrieval of data
associated with unit activity and calls for service. 	The CAD system consists of 15 servers, 42 dispatch
terminals, and over 100 remote access users. 	A total of 1,076,818 incidents were entered into the CAD
system in 2004. 	A total of 39,899 incidents were created by Troopers using mobile computer terminals. 	A total
of 949,197 transactions were processed by the CAD system from the mobile computer terminals. 			
The Virginia State Police CAD Management Information System (MIS) is a database containing all incident and
unit information collected in CAD since March 1999. 	CAD historical data is transferred to MIS nightly. 	The
database currently holds in excess of six million records. 	An Intranet web page allows VSP network users to
create custom queries to obtain desired data from the database. The web page also allows user access to

Table: 9
weekly and monthly reports. The MIS database allows the Department to track and access information never
before available, such as average response times, total number of calls, and average workloads. 			
Current projects include: 																
	• 	Interface into the new STARS radio system to allow STARS mobile users access to the CAD system.
	• 	New interface between the CAD system and the dispatch center phone systems. 				
	• 	New interface between the CAD system and the radio system. 								
	• 	Addition of a mapping system into the CAD. 											
	• 	Working with other agencies to bring their users onto the VSP mobile system. 	This will allow them
		access to VCIN/NCIC and car-to-car messaging between VSP and local police/sheriff departments.
Projects completed in 2004: 																
	• 	Complete CAD server hardware upgrade. 												
	• 	New real-time interface between Virginia Department of Transportation and VSP CAD. 	This interface
		transfers traffic incident data to VDOT allowing them to rapidly respond to traffic problems and to also
		post traffic related information on their website. 										
	• 	Expanded interface between 511 and VSP CAD. The program now offers travel information statewide
		through cellular 511 service and the Internet. 	The CAD system supplies them real time information on
		traffic related incidents. 															
	• 	New real-time in-house web page for display of working CAD incidents allowing command staff to
		remain informed on working calls. 													
Virtual Private Network (VPN) 															
In 	2002, 	the 	Telecommunications 	Engineering 	section 	of 	the 	Division 	began 	replacing 	the 	Department’s
internal and external dedicated circuit networks with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). 	This type of network
connection uses the Internet for agencies connecting to State Police and State Police offices throughout the
State. 	This networking configuration is cost efficient as multiple communications links to an agency can now
be combined to one link. 	In addition, it is secure, as the data is encrypted. Implementation of the VPN network
continued throughout 2004. 	As of December 2004, 425 sites had converted their applications to the VPN with
the remaining sites still in the process. 													
Implementation of the VPN network will continue until all agencies communicating with the State Police,
including 105 State Police offices, are using the VPN network. 	The VPN network supports the Virginia
Criminal 	Information 	Network 	(VCIN), 	the 	Live 	Scan 	Fingerprint 	System, 	the 	Automated 		Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS), and the Tactical Intelligence Processing System (TIPS). 				
Network Infrastructure 																
In 2004, conversion of the network infrastructure was completed. 	This upgrade provides for redundant pathing
between switches and routers at State Police Administrative Headquarters. 	It eliminates single points of failure
for the network and increases throughput for all processes on the network. 	With this upgrade, State Police is
able to provide a more stable and higher speed network and be in a better position for expansion of services
as required in the ever-changing law enforcement environment. 									
The Virginia Criminal Information Network System (VCIN) 									
The 	VCIN 	system 	processed 	over 	273 	million 	transactions 	in 	2004, 	which 	is 	an 	increase 	of 	30 	million
compared to 2003. 	In addition, Virginia State Police continues to convert agencies from Frame Relay to Virtual
Private Network (VPN). 	This will allow Virginia to support 128 bit encryption to satisfy the FBI security
requirements for dissemination of information. 	Additionally, we are now connected to the test FBI site “FLI
South Region” allowing us to do testing of new NCIC and NICS features before moving to the production
environment.

Disaster Recovery Project: State and Local Emergency Preparedness Program (SLEP) 				
A new Sun Microsystems model 6800 system has been installed at SPHQ and another Sun system was
installed at a Disaster Recovery site for fail over. All applications on the UNISYS mainframe were converted to
the Sun 6800 system in August 2004. The Sun system completely replaces the mainframe and it provides for
recovery to the Disaster site in case the State Police Administrative Headquarters site is not available for an
extended period. 																	
Personnel Division 														
The mission of the Personnel Division is to provide effective human resource management, with continued
emphasis on attracting qualified personnel and diversifying the Department’s work force. 					
Recruitment Unit 																	
The Recruitment Unit was restructured in 2003 to include a first sergeant, seven full-time recruiters and one
part-time secretary. 	Refocusing recruitment efforts has enabled the Department to concentrate on recruiting
and hiring the most qualified, diverse workforce to meet the demand of the future of policing in our global
community. 																	
Specific recruitment strategies were designed and implemented to aid in accomplishing the goals of the unit.
In 2004, the Recruitment Unit conducted a total of 603 programs at various venues across the Commonwealth,
utilizing the following strategies: 													
Recruitment “Lunch Boxes” – These programs are directed at Virginia’s universities, colleges, and community
colleges during the spring and fall semesters. 	Recruiters set up in student unions, dining halls, etc., to
introduce 	students 	to 	career 	opportunities 	within 	the 	Department. 	These 	programs 	also 	foster 	positive
relationships between the student citizens and law enforcement officers. 	Recruiters conduct three such
programs per month in their division. 													
Civic/Women/Minority 	Organizations 	– 	A 	variety 	of 	organizations 	have 	been 	identified 	in 	each 	of 	the
Department’s seven field divisions. 	Each recruiter is required to present three of these programs per month
with one of the three programs directed at women’s recruitment. 								
Military Recruitment – Each recruiter provides one program per month to transitioning military personnel.
Virginia has the most military facilities of any state in the nation and the military offers a very diverse candidate
pool. 																		
Student Athlete Recruitment – A minimum of two programs per month while school is in session at identified
college or university athletic unions and organizations. 	Recruiters have also identified health clubs and are
actively recruiting personnel who attend these facilities. 	One of the two programs per month must be focused
on women’s recruitment. 															
Career Fairs – Career fairs are conducted at various locations throughout the Commonwealth and in adjoining
states. 	Career fairs throughout the state are attended on a selected basis. 							
Career 	Sessions 		– 	Career 	Sessions 	have 	been 	scheduled 	quarterly 	throughout 	the 	state. 	Through
demonstrations and static displays of vehicles and equipment, Department members promote the department
while recruiters furnish employment information. The focus of these events is on the recruitment of minorities
and women. 																	
Employment Section 															
The Department hired 70 trooper trainees for the 107 th Basic Session that began on January 10, 2004, and 65
trooper trainees for the 108 th Basic Session that began on June 25, 2004. 	These troopers’ applications were
processed 	from 	a 	pool 	of 	1,951 	applications 	received. 	The 	applicants 	for 	these 	schools 	took 	the 	Law
Enforcement Services, Inc., battery of written tests and on-line personal history questionnaire. 				
									10

Table: 11
The Employment Section advertised 396 civilian positions throughout the year (236 full-time and 160 wage)
during 2004. 	This is a 48% increase in advertised positions since 2002. 	The total number of applicants who
applied in 2004 was 3,914. 													
The 	Department 	continued 	a 	Mediation 	Program 	for 	all 	agency 	employees. 	The 	Employment 	Section
processed 20 grievances during 2004. 											
During 2004, 69 volunteers gave 8,880 hours of their time in locations throughout the state. 	A volunteer
recognition event was held in the spring of 2004 for volunteers who served in 2003. 	Ms. Sara Redding Wilson,
Director of the Department of Human Resource Management (DHRM), served as the guest speaker. 	
An in-house Human Resource Management Database Program was created to benchmark the agency’s first
Workforce Planning Report. 	The Workforce Planning Report provides critical historical data on financial facts
and statistics, employment and agency trends, and characteristics of the State Police workforce. 	It also
provides our leadership with the necessary information to make and analyze the current workforce, identify
future workforce needs, and develop successive planning that addresses current and future business needs.
This program also dramatically improved the Department’s capability to prepare and negotiate salaries based
on internal alignment and other pay factors. 										
The Department implemented a new eight-hour orientation program for new employees which now includes
rehires 	and 	wage 	employees. 	The 	orientation 	was 	also 	changed 	from 	quarterly 	to 	monthly 	to 	provide
information in a timelier manner. 	The first 66-page Orientation handbook was created to provide a broad
overview of Virginia State Police operations, Department procedures and policies, and a complete explanation
of employee benefits, including leave types, payroll options, and insurance choices. 					
In 	accordance 	with 	the 	Virginia 	Department 	of 	Human 	Resource 	Management 	(DHRM) 	Policy 	1.61
(Telecommuting), 	our 	Department 	established 	internal 	policies 	and 	procedures 	related 	to 	telecommuting.
General Order 36 was revised to establish a telecommuting and alternative work policy under which eligible
employees may telecommute, participate in alternate work schedules, or both. 					
The Employment Unit provided 38 hours of training to Department employees on Workplace Harassment and
Workplace Violence. 	Education and training to all employees continues to prove successful. There were no
complaints of workplace harassment or workplace violence in 2004. 						
Classification, Compensation, Transactions and Records Section (CCTR) 				
During the 2004 year, the CCTR section processed 104 new employees into pay status, processed 103
promotions, 166 transfers, 49 separations, and a large number of address and name changes. 	During this
period, the section also received a large number of employment history and verification requests, records
subpoenas, several Freedom of Information Act inquiries and several legal inquiries. 	A number of requests for
purchase of individual firearms were also processed. 									
The 	CCTR 	section 	also 	received, 	audited 	and 	processed 	eight 	Classification 		requests 	from 	the
Superintendent’s Office, four from BASS, 16 from BCI, 43 from BFO, 32 from CJIS, ten from Property and
Finance, three from Data Processing, ten from Personnel, one from Communications, and six from Training.
This section also received and processed one in-band adjustment request from BASS, one from BCI, 23 from
BFO, six from CJIS, two from Property and Finance, and one from Planning. 					
In addition, this section established 30 wage positions and responded to 4 salary surveys. 	CCTR also
maintained all weight control records on all sworn personnel, central Personnel Records, all Background
Records, all Position files and selected medical files for the Department. 	Additionally, this section reviewed
and processed all VEC inquiries, processed employees entering and returning from military service, and
analyzed and returned audit exceptions reports for all pay transactions. 						
This section reviewed and processed 2,461 performance evaluations for 2004, which included 689 rated as
extraordinary contributor, 1,018 major contributor, 749 contributors, three marginal contributors and two below
contributor. 	In this period, nine appeals were received, seven ratings were increased and two were sustained.
								11 								
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 12 of 29”
Table: 12
Wage employees were also rated in this same period and their position records were updated for the next
cycle. 														
A study of sworn pay was conducted and recommendations were presented to the 2004 General Assembly
and Governor to address salary compression. 	As a result, the Department received over $9 million in funding
to implement a sworn pay inequity plan. 	This plan raised the starting pay for sworn employees and adjusted
the salaries of those underpaid based upon their years of service in comparison to similar salaries paid to their
peers in the same rank. 	This part of the plan was implemented in September 25, 2004. 	In addition, the
Department adopted a plan to decrease the rate of salary compression by using standard rates of $4,275 or
10% (whichever is greater) for career progression increases and $5,700 or 10% (whichever is greater) for
promotions. 	This part of the plan was implemented November 25, 2004. 					
The Department is also reviewing civilian pay compression and is currently reviewing civilian salaries for
employees in the same roles and having similar years of service in comparison to those in other state
agencies. 														
Property and Finance Division 										
The 	Property 	and 	Finance 	Division 	encompasses 	a 	wide 	range 	of 	financial 	and 	property 	management
functions. 	It is responsible for preparing, monitoring, and accounting for the Department's annual operating
budget, which was in excess of $197,167,625 for fiscal year 2004. 	It was responsible for the procurement,
warehousing, and distribution of more than $18,853,198 in supplies and equipment last year. 	The Property
and Finance Division is also responsible for the management and maintenance of more than 110 buildings and
grounds across the state. 												
During calendar year 2004, construction continued on the new Combined Headquarters Addition / Emergency
Operations Center. 	Construction was started for the new Fusion Center, which will be incorporated into the
new headquarters addition. 	Construction was completed on the new Staunton Area Office and the new Clifton
Forge (Alleghany County) Area Office. 										
In addition to its property and financial management duties, the Division oversees the mailroom and printing
sections, which processed 442,715 pieces of mail during 2004, and prints an average of 6.5 million copies
annually. 	It also manages the garage, which is responsible for equipping and issuing a fleet of approximately
2,100 vehicles. 													
The Property and Finance Division has the responsibility for the Virginia Excess Military Property Program,
which allows Virginia law enforcement agencies to procure, at no cost, military property and equipment that is
in excess of the Department of Defense needs. 	The Department is appointed by the Governor as the point of
contact, and provides a state coordinator. 	The program serves over 250 Virginia law enforcement agencies
and in 2004 the program distributed goods valued over $2.2 million dollars. 					
In 1998, the Division was tasked with the development, implementation and day-to-day operational control of
the State and Local Law Enforcement Procurement Program, “The 1122 Program.” 	This program allows state
and local law enforcement agencies to purchase law enforcement equipment suitable for counter-narcotic
activities through the federal procurement channels at substantial savings. 	During 2004, over $3,205,918 was
purchased through this program, saving the Department $1,494,715. 						
Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) 							
The Statewide Agencies Radio System (STARS) Program was originally conceived in the mid 1990s to be an
upgrade to the Virginia State Police's antiquated 1977 land mobile radio system. 	As planning progressed, both
technology advances and direction from state government led the program to the present concept of a shared
system composed of the 20 state agencies that use two-way radio communication as a regular part of their
operations. 														
On July 13, 2004, Colonel W. Steven Flaherty, State 	Police Superintendent, and Mr. 	Mark Moon, Vice
President 	and 	General 	Manager 	of 	Motorola, 	signed 	a 	$329-million 	contract 	between 	Motorola 	and 	the
						12 								
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 13 of 29”
Table: 13
Commonwealth of Virginia for the design, construction, and implementation of the Statewide Agencies Radio
System (STARS). 		A ceremonial contract signing was held on July 16, 2004, in conjunction with a press
conference. The implementation phase of STARS is now underway. 						
To 	support 	the 	large 	increase 	of 	user 	agencies 	and 	radios, 	the 	microwave 	backbone 	of 	the 	system 	is
undergoing a complete renovation. 	The 87 existing tower sites will grow to 94 sites and the network is now
designed to have alternate paths, or loops, to provide continuously high reliability in the event of path outage.
There are 45 of these tower sites that will be used for the actual two-way communications with the user's
mobile and portable radios. 	From these sites, the Commonwealth personnel will receive quality, statewide,
mobile radio coverage. STARS will be one of the first geographically statewide systems to employ digital
trunked technology in the VHF 150 MHz band. 									
It will also be one of the first states to employ an Integrated Voice and Data (IV&D) land mobile radio
architecture, which uses the same mobile radio for both voice and law enforcement computer communications.
Virginia will, therefore, have statewide mobile data coverage. Integrating the voice and data networks saves
the Commonwealth the expense of a separate data infrastructure and an additional radio/modem in each
vehicle. 	The IV&D infrastructure will also provide Over-the-Air Re-Keying (OTAR) of the radio encryption, a
recent technological innovation. 	This allows the encryption codes resident in the vehicle’s equipment to be
managed remotely. 														
The digital trunking technology allows different functional groupings of people to communicate privately within
their own organizational elements known as “talk-groups” even while other groups are communicating among
themselves. 	As the members move throughout Virginia, the system will automatically track them so they will
not be out of communications with other members of their group. 							
The digital trunking technology will also be carried a step further for the agencies that use portable radios while
away from their vehicles. STARS will include a Digital-Vehicular-Repeater-System (DVRS), which will translate
the VHF signal used between the tower and vehicle, into an 700 MHz signal used for vehicle-to-portable
communications. 															
STARS is scheduled to first be operational in December 2005 in the Richmond area, which includes four cities
and 21 counties. The STARS Project is scheduled to be implemented over a six-year period. 				
Operational Stages 														
	• 	Richmond 	-- 	December 2005 										
	• 	Tidewater 	-- 	May 2008 												
	• 	Culpeper 	-- 	July 2008 												
	• 	Northern Virginia 	-- 	October 2008 									
	• 	Salem 	-- 	April 2009 												
	• 	Appomattox 	-- 	May 2009 											
	• 	Wytheville 	-- 	September 2009 										
A single interface link will be provided to each of the counties and independent cities to bring interoperability at
no cost to the jurisdiction. In a wide scale emergency, localities may be connected to each other in this
manner, thus providing regional intercommunications. 								
The implementation of each of these exciting and cutting-edge technologies into STARS will provide the
Commonwealth with critical public safety communications. 							
The following Commonwealth of Virginia agencies and other organizations are STARS participants: 		
Alcoholic Beverage Control 			Juvenile Justice 							
Capitol Police 							Military Affairs 								
Conservation and Recreation 			Mines, Minerals, and Energy

BUREAU OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
The Department provides a thorough and comprehensive investigation of all criminal matters mandated by
statute and established Department policy through the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Bureau is
mandated to investigate any matter referred by the Governor. Additionally, the Attorney General,
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs and Grand Juries may request the Department to
investigate matters, which constitute Class 1, 2 or 3 felonies. The Bureau also conducts investigations of
elected officials when directed by the Governor, Attorney General or Grand Juries. The Bureau consists of the
Criminal Intelligence Division, Support Services Division, Drug Enforcement Section, General Investigation
Section and the Insurance Fraud Program. 	
Criminal Intelligence Division 	
The primary purpose of the Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) is to identify, document, and disseminate
criminal intelligence concerning persons involved in organized crime or terrorism. 	CID is currently composed
of six units and one section – the Analytical Unit, Research Unit, Field Intelligence Unit, Financial Crimes
Intelligence Unit, Technical Support Unit, Computer Evidence Recovery Unit, and the Tactical Intelligence
Processing System (TIPS) Section. 	
17 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 18 of 29”
Table: 18
CID’s Analytical Unit operates the Virginia Criminal Intelligence Center (VCIC), which is a repository of 	
intelligence information that is available to all Virginia law enforcement personnel. 	VCIC’s analysts provide
research and analytical support to criminal justice agencies. The analysts assigned use multiple databases and
are in daily contact with local, state, and federal organizations in order to accomplish their mission. 	
The two agents assigned to the Research Unit accomplish a wide variety of tasks. They assist the other CID
units with specific research tasks, field investigations including surveillance, Interpol requests, and officer
safety issues, and the handling of fictitious identifications for undercover personnel. 	
The Field Intelligence Unit interacts with investigators and task forces statewide to collect and supply 	
intelligence, including information on current investigations. The agents also routinely use the Domestic
Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System. 	The unit consists of agents that are placed in each of the 	
Department’s seven divisions. 		
The Financial Crimes Intelligence Unit, consisting of a Special Agent and Financial Analyst, gathers 	
intelligence on individuals and businesses that are suspected of financial crimes with a primary emphasis on
money laundering. 	Once the intelligence reveals possible criminal activity, the case is turned over to a Bureau
of Criminal Investigation Field Office for criminal investigation. 	
In 2004, the Technical Support Unit received 759 requests for service. 	Of those requests 734 were in support
of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 	Each request was directly related to ongoing criminal
investigations, which were supported with the installation of audio and video recording equipment. 	The unit
continues to support significant investigations and uses methods and technologies to assist any requesting law
enforcement agency. 	The unit continues to provide audio enhancement services to all law enforcement
agencies, as well as supporting the courts and Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ offices through installation and
operation of closed circuit television systems for victims of child abuse cases. 	The Hostage/Barricade Unit
program continues to support state and local law enforcement through the deployment of sophisticated
technical equipment. The Hostage/Barricade Unit responded to 18 Hostage/Barricade incident requests.
The Computer Evidence Recovery Unit (CERU) provides assistance to local, state and federal law 	
enforcement agencies with on-scene execution of search warrants for computer-related evidence, evidence
recovery through forensic examination, and quarterly training classes in computer search and seizure. 	In
2004, the CERU assisted with 89 investigations involving 3,946 gigabytes of data on 134 computers and 2,145
digital equipment items. 		
The TIPS Section is currently working with law enforcement agencies throughout the Commonwealth in order
to provide them with the Tactical Intelligence Processing System that will allow intelligence to be entered,
stored, and shared with all agencies in the system. 	The TIPS Section is also currently working with public
safety agencies statewide to provide them with the Virginia Critical Information Shared System, a Terrorism
Bulletin Board system that will allow intelligence to be posted on a six-tiered system. 	The top or first tier of the
system will require a Top Secret clearance while the sixth tier of the system will be able to be viewed by the
general public. 		
CID is also responsible for the Terrorism Hotline, Drug Hotline, and the Domestic Terrorism 	
Tracking/Assessment System. 	The Terrorism Hotline has received 781 calls since its inception in 2001. The
Domestic Terrorism Tracking/Assessment System was established to assess vulnerabilities and threats related
to terrorism in the Commonwealth of Virginia. 		
Support Services Division (SSD) 		
The Support Services Division (SSD) was established in 2004 as a result of the Department’s reorganization of
BCI. The Insurance Fraud Division and Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) programs were decentralized and
absorbed within SSD. However, the Special Agents assigned to these units have continued their current
investigative capacities operating out of their respective BCI field offices. 	
	18 	
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 19 of 29”
Table: 19
The SSD is responsible for the law enforcement training, public awareness campaigns and insurance industry
outreach programs for both the Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) and Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.). 	The
Bomb, Arson and Drug Diversion units also make up the SSD as well as the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal
Interdiction Unit (CCI). 	The SSD provides statistical gathering, technical training and financial management
support for these units. 													
The H.E.A.T. and Insurance Fraud toll-free telephone hotlines are administered and maintained by the SSD.
Initial notifications of suspected insurance fraud and auto theft activities are received via the SSD hotlines,
Web sites, e-mails and faxes. The notifications are reviewed and distributed to the appropriate local law
enforcement 	agencies 	or 	to 	the 	Bureau 	of 	Criminal 	Investigation’s 	field 	offices 	where 	investigations 	are
conducted by the Department’s Special Agents on a case-by-case basis. 				
Drug Enforcement (DES) 										
DES continues in its aggressive enforcement of Virginia’s narcotics and substance abuse laws. The Section
remains committed to its support of local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to enforce these state laws. 	
The DES mission is accomplished through the efforts of sworn members and civilian support personnel in six
distinct functional areas: 												
• DES Regional Field Offices 											
• Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces 										
• Joint VSP/Federal Task Forces 										
• Marijuana Eradication/Operation Grand Slam 								
• G.I.A.N.T. Operations 													
• Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion 										
DES Regional Field Offices - Seven DES Regional Field Offices perform operational narcotics enforcement
investigations, as well as support special operations (undercover, wire intercept, marijuana eradication) etc.,
initiated by other law enforcement entities. 	There are 100 special agents available for enforcement and task
force duties at seven field offices. 										
From Jan. 1, 2004 through Dec. 31, 2004, the field offices participated in 1,581 investigations that yielded
$15,632,260 in seized narcotics, $191,030 in seized currency, and 293 persons arrested on 409 felony and
misdemeanor charges. 	In addition, 425 persons were arrested on 625 felony and misdemeanor charges in
cases where DES assisted other agencies. 	DES Special Agents also seized 38 vehicles and 106 weapons. 	
Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces – DES participates in 22 state and local multi-jurisdictional task forces,
encompassing 81 local jurisdictions. 	Twenty-nine State Police Special Agents and 141 local officers were
assigned to state and local task forces. 										
During 	2004, 	the 	multi-jurisdictional 	task 	forces 	participated 	in 	3,546 	investigations 	that 	accounted 	for
$13,119,996 in illicit drug seizures, $396,441 in seized U.S. currency, and 1751 persons arrested on 2,367
charges. 	In addition, task forces assisted their agencies in cases that resulted in 474 persons arrested on 656
charges. 	These task forces also seized 59 vehicles and 94 weapons. 					
Federal Task Forces – DES participated in nine federal narcotics task forces during 2004. 	Fourteen State
Police Special Agents, as well as officers from local police departments and agents from the Drug Enforcement
Administration 	(DEA), 	Federal 	Bureau 	of 	Investigations 	(FBI) 	and 	Internal 	Revenue 	Service 	(IRS) 	were
assigned. 	The federal joint task forces conducted 155 investigations that accounted for $6,595,770 in drug
seizures and 11 persons arrested on 34 charges. 	These task forces also assisted with 77 arrests on 94
charges and seized 20 weapons. 										
Marijuana Eradication Program – The Commonwealth remains a prime location for the cultivation of the
marijuana plant. Virginia’s domestically grown marijuana has the potential for being a major cash crop. With
DEA funding, the Department of State Police, along with assistance from other state and local law enforcement
								19 							
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 20 of 29”
Table: 20
agencies, 	and 	the 	Virginia 	Army 	National 	Guard, 	Reconnaissance 	Air 	Interdiction 	Detachment 	(RAID),
conducted a regular program to eradicate domestically-grown marijuana. 	The State Police and local law
enforcement agencies found 8,104 plants in 294 outdoor plots. There were also 1,502 marijuana plants
eradicated in 18 indoor grows. 	Marijuana eradication operations resulted in 127 arrests. 	Seizures included 48
weapons, vehicles, and other personal property valued at $156,663. 	Considering the estimated yield of
consumable marijuana from each plant, the cash value of marijuana not reaching the streets as a result of
eradication would be in excess of $9.6 million. 										
Governor’s Initiative Against Narcotics Trafficking (GIANT) – The GIANT mission is to facilitate and assure
coordination and cooperation among member agencies. Six Special Agents are assigned to GIANT. 	The five
facets of the GIANT mission are: 												
1. 	Development of intelligence pertaining to domestically grown marijuana, both indoor and outdoor, with the
eradication of this marijuana and successful prosecution of the growers as a primary goal of GIANT; 		
2. 	Developing intelligence concerning air smuggling into Virginia using contacts to monitor suspicious activities
of all known airports in the Commonwealth, and by locating clandestine airstrips and identifying users; 		
3. 	Reducing 	the 	supply 	of 	illegal 	drugs 	entering 	and 	being 	transported 	within 	the 	Commonwealth 	by
interdicting drug shipments via land, air, and waterway; 								
4. 	Developing procedures that eliminate duplication of activities and breakdowns in communication among the
various state agencies and law enforcement authorities, and; 								
5. 	Utilizing the resources of county and city law enforcement agencies to the maximum extent possible. 	
GIANT performed 282 operations during 2004 that resulted in 198 arrests, the seizure of $7,658,942 worth of
narcotics, 90 weapons, 27 vehicles, and $442,636 in U.S. currency. 						
Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion – The diversion of legitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit purposes continues to
be a severe problem in Virginia. In fact, drug diversion predates the massive abuse of other drugs we know so
well 	today. 	The 	Pharmaceutical 	Drug 	Diversion 	agents 	work 	with 	the 	DEA, 	the 	Department 	of 	Health
Professions, and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, plus local law enforcement agencies to
eliminate the diversion of prescription drugs to illicit purposes. 							
During 2004, Drug Diversion received 995 complaints of diversion activities throughout the Commonwealth. 	In
responses to these complaints, 498 investigations were initiated and the 15 Special Agents assigned to Drug
Diversion arrested a total of 434 persons on 634 charges. 	Of the 434 persons arrested, 17 were licensed
health care professionals. 	No search warrants were executed during the past year. 				
A major educational role of Drug Diversion is teaching local law enforcement officials about the extent of the
drug diversion problem in their own jurisdictions and what they can do about it. 	This role also included
educating health care professionals, both physicians and pharmacists, about the magnitude of the problem and
the importance of self-policing and ensuring the integrity of their individual health care delivery systems.
During 2004, 3 presentations were conducted for 166 health care professionals, and 2 presentations were
conducted for 200 individuals in law enforcement. 										
General Investigations Section (GIS) 										
GIS responds to complaints about violations that constitute Class 1, 2 and 3 felonies. Investigations are
discretionary. Major emphasis is placed on responding to requests from the Governor, Attorney General,
Commonwealth’s Attorneys, Grand Juries, and Chiefs of Police and Sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth. 	
A major priority of the GIS is to provide specialized assistance to local law enforcement agencies. Personnel
are permanently assigned to strategic locations throughout the state to ensure that adequate response can be
made to any location in a reasonable time. The GIS has 192 authorized positions, of which 150 are Special
								20 								
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 21 of 29”
Table: 21
Agents assigned to conduct investigations. The remaining 42 positions are supervisors and support personnel.
During 2004, GIS conducted 3,754 investigations, of which 1,934 or 51.5% resulted from requests from other
law enforcement agencies. GIS Special Agents made a total of 2,879 arrests. 					
Crime Scene Examination – The GIS is staffed with crime scene technicians trained by the Division of
Forensic Science. 	The technicians are often called upon by other State Police employees and by local law
enforcement 	agencies 	to 	examine 	and 	evaluate 	evidence 	at 	crime 	scenes. 	In 	2004, 	247 	scenes 	were
examined in cases of murder, rape, robbery, arson, burglary, and numerous other major crimes. 		
Fugitive Apprehension – Eight Special Agents and one Trooper/Agent staff Fugitive Apprehension. 		There
are two Special Agents assigned to Fugitive Apprehension in the Richmond Field Office, one Special Agent
and one Trooper/Agent assigned to the Fairfax Field Office, and one Special Agent at the Appomattox,
Chesapeake, Culpeper, Salem, and Wytheville field offices. 								
The Fugitive Apprehension mission is to affect the swift apprehension of all fugitives, particularly in connection
with 	violent 	crimes. 	Agents 	assigned 	to 	Fugitive 	Apprehension 	work 	closely 	with 	local 	and 	federal 	law
enforcement agencies to accomplish its goal. During 2004, members were assigned 655 cases and made
1,171 arrests. 														
National White-Collar Crime Center – The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the
Department’s representative to the National White-Collar Crime Center, a federally-funded program with 1,583
member agencies and 155 associate member agencies throughout the country. 	Members of the center assist
with the investigation and prosecution of various white-collar crimes. 							
Polygraph – There are 22 Special Agents trained as examiners who administer polygraph examinations upon
request. During 2004, 681 criminal polygraphs were conducted. 								
Violent Crimes Investigative Unit – During 2004, this unit investigated 344 cases which included 220
requests from other agencies. 	A total of 177 arrests were recorded for the year. 					
The Violent Crimes Investigative Unit opened 44 cases for the year. Ten cases were entered into the Violent
Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP), which is a national data-base established by the U. S. Department of
Justice and maintained by the FBI. The Special Agent assigned to this unit also presented 61 programs
relating to homicides, sex crimes and hostage negotiations. 								
Hostage Negotiation – The Department now has 31 trained hostage negotiators available for hostage or
barricade situations. 	During 2004, the negotiators trained 21 times with local law enforcement and State Police
tactical teams. 	They responded to 17 barricaded subject situations. 							
Economic/Cyber Crimes Unit – This Unit consists of nine High Technology Crimes Special Agents, and 27
Special Agent accountants. 	The Cyber Crime agents opened 180 cases in 2004, involving a variety of
investigations for this Department and other local and federal agencies. The Special Agent Accountants
concentrate on white-collar crime and conducted 377 investigations in 2004. 					
Arson Investigation – A Lieutenant is the chief arson investigator and coordinates activities between the
Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other investigative agencies throughout the state. 	Arson investigation
training and assistance are provided when requested by localities. 	During 2004, the chief arson investigator
provided or assisted in providing the following training related to arson investigations and explosives related
matters: 														
	. 	Investigators attend a weeklong Arson Investigation School from statewide law enforcement, fire
		services and insurance agencies. 									
	. 	Training 	sessions 	are 	conducted 	exclusively 	for 	local 	fire 	services 	departments 	in 	the
		recognition and detection of incendiary fires. 								
	. 	Training sessions are provided across the state to officers on handling bomb threats, bomb
		scene search techniques and suspected explosive devices. 						
							21 								
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 22 of 29”
Table: 22
	. 	Training and demonstrations are conducted on explosive recognition and blast characteristics
		for law enforcement and fire service personnel in seminars, conferences and academies. 		
Within the Bureau, there are a number of Special Agents who have been specifically trained to investigate
arson-related matters. 	In 2004, GIS conducted 308 fire scene investigations. 	Of these investigations, 104
were 	determined 	to 	be 	incendiary 	in 	origin, 	56 	were 	determined 	to 	be 	accidental 	and 	148 	were 	of 	an
undetermined origin. 																			
Bomb and Explosives-Related Matters – There are 30 trained bomb technicians assigned to the GIS. 	In
2004, there were 339 explosives-related incidents requiring the GIS to respond and provide explosives-related
expertise. 	During 2004, there were 23 actual explosive devices rendered safe and 105 hoax and suspicious
items requiring examination by bomb technicians. 													
Bomb 	technicians 	continue 	to 	present 	bomb 	threat 	presentations 	to 	school 	staffs 	throughout 	the
Commonwealth. 																				
Auto Theft Agent Activities – The Virginia State Police Auto Theft Agents are funded by the (H.E.A.T.) Help
Eliminate 	Auto 	Theft 	Program. 	A 	total 	of 	eight 	Special 	Agents 	are 	assigned 		to 	Richmond, 	Culpeper,
Appomattox, Wytheville, Chesapeake, Salem and Fairfax divisions. These Special Agents work closely with
the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance Crimes Bureau, and federal and local law
enforcement agencies to investigate crimes related to auto theft rings, chop-shops, insurance fraud and other
illegal activity. 																				
In 2004, the eight Special Agents conducted 447 motor vehicle theft investigations, resulting in 36 arrests and
the recovery of 150 stolen vehicles and pieces of heavy equipment with a combined value of $2,807,550. They
also received more than 438 requests for assistance from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.
Auto Theft Agents coordinate monthly regional meetings with other auto theft investigators and insurance
company special investigative units across the Commonwealth of Virginia. 	These meetings are held to discuss
current automobile theft trends and coordinate enforcement efforts among law enforcement agencies. 		In
addition, members of the unit provide auto theft investigation training to numerous Troopers and local law-
enforcement officers at the Virginia State Police Academy and regional academies. 							
Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T) – The Help Eliminate Auto Theft (H.E.A.T.) Program is an insurance
industry-funded 	program 	established 	by 	Section 	38.2-414 	of 	the 	Code 	of 	Virginia. 	The 	Program 	was
established in 1992 to receive and reward auto theft related tips. 	Callers who provide information that leads to
the arrest of individuals for auto theft related crimes become eligible for cash rewards. 	On January 1, 2004 the
maximum reward increased from $10,000 to $25,000. 	Seven full $10,000 rewards were paid to callers before
this increase took effect. 	Annually, 10 to 12 citizens earn H.E.A.T. rewards by helping the police. 			
The 	Department’s 	H.E.A.T. 	Program 	provides 	leadership 	to 	over 	165 	state 	and 	local 	police 	and 	sheriff
agencies working cooperatively to reduce auto theft throughout Virginia. 	During 2004, the H.E.A.T. staff
consisted of a first sergeant, two special agents, one trooper-agent and two program support technicians.
H.E.A.T. personnel support auto theft reduction efforts by providing training, conducting promotional events,
conducting 	prevention/VIN 	Etching 	events, 	offering 	grant 	funding, 	procuring 		specialized 	equipment,
coordinating monthly meetings of regional auto theft investigators, providing Department of Motor Vehicles’
documentation to support prosecutions and by assembling auto theft statistical information. 	Over 161 title
searches were completed for auto theft investigators in the United States and Canada. 						
H.E.A.T. conducts two basic and one advanced auto theft investigation school for law enforcement annually.
In 2004, H.E.A.T. and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association implemented a new 16-hour auto theft
prevention school which will be offered to crime prevention specialists and Operation HEATWave Coordinators
4 times per year. The H.E.A.T. office also began the production of five bait cars that will be employed in high
theft jurisdictions to turn up the “HEAT” on auto thieves. 												
										22 												
Name: “Table 1 of 1 on page 23 of 29”
Table: 23
The H.E.A.T. Program works with Neathawk Dubuque and Packett, a private marketing agency, to increase
the public’s awareness about the problem of auto theft, auto theft prevention devices and strategies, the
H.E.A.T. Program, the H.E.A.T. Hotline (1-800-947-HEAT) and cash rewards of up to $25,000. 	Citizens are
directed to the H.E.A.T. Web Site at: www.heatreward.com, for additional H.E.A.T. Program information. 	The
public is encouraged to call 1-800-947-HEAT (4328) if they ever learn of any auto theft related information. 	In
addition, H.E.A.T. promotional messages run throughout Virginia on television, radio, billboards, newspapers
and on three NASCAR race cars. 		
Cooperation of Virginia’s law enforcement community and the public has resulted in a momentous reduction in
Virginia’s auto theft rate. 	Since 1991, Virginia’s motor vehicle theft rate per 100,000 inhabitants has declined
by approximately 30%. 	Working together to protect cars by employing the “Layered Approach to Protection”
and educating the public regarding the toll-free hotline to increase tips has proven to be an effective strategy to
make Virginia a safer place to own and operate a motor vehicle. 	
Insurance Fraud Program (IFP) – Effective Jan. 1, 1999, the General Assembly approved establishing an
Insurance Fraud Investigative Program within the Department of State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
In 2003, the General Assembly lifted the sunset clause making the Insurance Fraud Program a permanent unit
of the Department. The purposes of this Unit are threefold: 	
1. 	Initiate independent inquiries and conduct independent investigations when the Department has reason to
	believe that insurance fraud may have been or is currently being committed, and to undertake studies to
	determine the extent of such insurance fraud; 	
2. 	Respond to notification or complaints alleging insurance fraud generated by federal, state and local police,
	other law-enforcement authorities, governmental agencies or Units, and any other person; 	
3. 	Review notices and reports of insurance fraud; select the incidents of suspected fraud that, in its judgment,
	require further detailed investigation; and conduct the investigations. 	
Recent examples of insurance fraud include faking auto crashes, staging burglaries, fraudulently reporting
theft, and falsifying Workers’ Compensation injuries. The IFP is constantly uncovering some newly developed
“scam” aimed at fraudulently receiving claim funds from insurance carriers. Insurance fraud has a significant
economic impact on society as represented by the total amount of claimed loss that was actually received by
individuals submitting suspected insurance fraud claims. During 2004, more than $2.5 million was actually
collected by individuals suspected of insurance fraud and the total amount involved in suspicious claims that
was attempted, but not collected, was $7.9 million. 	
It has been estimated that insurance fraud costs each insured Virginia household approximately $200 in
additional insurance premiums annually and as much as $1,000 for the increased cost of goods and services.
This Program is dedicated to reducing the impact of fraudulent insurance claims on the law-abiding citizens of
Virginia. The hotline for persons to call in with information about suspected insurance fraud receives frequent
activity. The toll-free telephone number is: 	1-877-62FRAUD. 	
In 2004 2,076 calls were received through the toll-free hotline service. A reward program has been established
to provide a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of individuals
committing insurance fraud. IFP operates the reward program by use of the insurance fraud hotline and
through information obtained during investigations and provided by the general public. A reward committee has
been selected to make recommendations based on written policy and procedures. Their recommendations are
forwarded through channels to the Superintendent for final approval. 	
An Internet Web site is available to provide information on the various aspects of insurance fraud to the
general public, law enforcement, the insurance industry and media. 	A portion of the Web site provides the
insurance industry and the general public the capability to report incidents of suspected insurance fraud
directly to the Insurance Fraud Program on line. This service is available through the Department’s Web site
and www.stampoutfraud.com

There are currently 21 Special Agents assigned to investigate insurance fraud. 	Their primary focus is on
fraudulent property and casualty insurance claims that in essence violate Section 18.2-178, obtaining money
under false pretense. The law now requires that if insurance professionals have reason to believe that
someone is violating or will be violating this statute, they are compelled to disclose this information to the
Department of State Police. 											
During 2004, more than 1,385 notifications of potential property and casualty insurance fraud were received
from the insurance industry, law enforcement agencies and the general public. There were 278 criminal
investigations initiated by the Special Agents and 98 arrests for insurance fraud and related offenses. 	Ninety-
three insurance fraud cases were prosecuted, which resulted in court-ordered restitution of $356,058 during
2004. 														
Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit (CCI) 					
Since its establishment on July 1, 2000 by the Virginia General Assembly, the Special Operations Division
(SOD) has undergone a remarkable transformation. SOD’s primary mission was the interdiction of narcotics on
Virginia’s highways, public transportation systems as well as in schools and businesses. 	SOD provided
outstanding assistance to local police departments from around the state requesting assistance to augment
their resources by effectively addressing localized drug and firearm-related problems/situations that exceeded
their existing resources. 												
Due to the events of September 11, 2001, and a recent reorganization within the Virginia State Police, the
Special Operations Division was re-designated as the Special Operations Unit and expanded its personnel,
offices and duties to include response to acts of terrorism. 	This unit carried out the Virginia State Police
Bureau 	of 	Field 	Operations 	(BFO) 	Homeland 	Security 	responsibilities 	related 	to 	response 	and 	recovery
operations. 	The seven areas within the unit served to coordinate the response of other resources and were
core members of the Statewide Regional Response Teams. 						
On January 10, 2003, the name of the unit was changed to the Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit
(CCI) with fully operational teams in each of the seven traditional State Police Divisions. 	The area teams were
comprised of a Sergeant, a Special Agent, a Trooper, and all narcotic canine handlers within the geographical
boundaries of the area. 	In addition to making each of the teams fully operational, CCI was assigned the
mission 	to 	devote 	resources 	and 	efforts 	in 	performing 	Homeland 	Security 	responsibilities, 	conducting
advanced criminal interdiction investigations, and providing assistance to local law enforcement agencies in
communities were the quality of life for its citizens had been negatively impacted by criminal activities. 	On
August 10, 2003, CCI was transferred to the Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI). 			
In November 2004, the mission of CCI evolved to incorporate a new strategic initiative developed to diminish
the violence associated with gang-related crimes. 	CCI provides assistance to local law enforcement agencies
with specially-trained members in identifying gang members and enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth
related to gang violence and illegal criminal activities. 						
The Counter-Terrorism & Criminal Interdiction Unit participated in three successful City/State Partnerships
during the year 2004. 	The statistics for these partnerships are as follows:

Homeland Security - The CCI Homeland Security Unit currently consists of 46 sworn employees (authorized
49 sworn employees) assigned to eight regional teams, prepared to respond to a terror related event to
recover evidence and assist other federal, state and local agencies. 	Currently 45 of the team members are
certified Hazardous Material Technicians trained to enter a scene that may be contaminated with biological,
chemical, or radiological substances. 	Each team is equipped with detection and monitoring equipment to
identify and classify hazardous substances employed during a terror attack and collect samples for the
purposes determining treatment for persons exposed, and obtaining evidence for prosecution. 		Fifteen of the
team 	members 	have 	completed 	Environmental 	Crimes 	Investigation 	training 	provided 	by 	the 	Virginia
Department of Fire Programs. 													
Additional training is on-going to further prepare the teams to deal with terrorist-related bombings, suicide
bombers, radiological attacks, and chemical nerve agent attacks. 	All team members are being trained to
operate within the National Incident Management Systems (NIMS) Incident Command System. 	The teams
attend 	stakeholder 	meetings 	and 	training 	with 	the 	local 	Hazardous 	Materials 	Teams 	and 	the 	Virginia
Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) Regional Hazardous Material Officers. 	Our teams also
conduct training quarterly to maintain certification utilizing assigned Personal Protective Equipment and Self
Contained Breathing Apparatus. 													
The unit is expecting to take delivery of seven specialty vehicles in May of 2005 that will be equipped with the
assigned 	radiological 	detection 	equipment, 	Multi-Rae 	Combustible 	Gas 	Indicator 	equipped 		with 	a 	photo
ionization detector to identify volatile and toxic gases, satellite television, weather monitoring equipment,
emergency decontamination station and a rehabilitation tent. 	The unit is also awaiting delivery of three
Hazardous Material Identification Instruments that will allow field analysis of liquids and powders. 				
			BUREAU OF FIELD OPERATIONS 					
The Bureau of Field Operations has as its primary responsibility the patrolling of over 64,000 miles of state
roadways and interstate highways throughout Virginia. 	Uniformed State Police personnel provide both traffic
enforcement and criminal law enforcement as the need arises and based upon the ability of local law 		
enforcement to respond. The bureau also is responsible for managing the Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection
Program regarding the enforcement of motor carrier and commercial vehicle safety regulations, and the 	
Aviation Unit that provides aerial support for law enforcement activities and emergency medical evacuations.
The Commonwealth's geography and size dictate the need to decentralize uniformed police services into 	
seven field divisions. 	These divisions are further subdivided into 48 State Police areas that consist of one or
more cities and/or counties. 	Manpower is allocated based upon workload demands at the city and county
level.

Operation Alert 		
Operation Alert is a program especially designed to interdict criminal activity on the highways of Virginia.
Specialized training is provided to troopers to heighten their awareness when engaged in traffic stops and
during public contacts urging the trooper to look for unusual circumstances that typically indicate criminal
conduct and activity. 		
The Department's efforts in Operation Alert during 2004 resulted in troopers making a total of 8,322 Operation
Alert Traffic Stops that resulted in 4,475 arrests and the filing of 3,031 criminal charges. Sworn personnel
removed an estimated $1,382,038 worth of narcotics and dangerous drugs from the highways of the 	
Commonwealth of Virginia. 	In addition, troopers seized $306,281 in currency and 164 weapons as a result of
the Department's enforcement effort. 		
Safety Division 		
With the implementation of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program in 1932, Virginia embarked upon and has
continued in a leadership role in the promotion of highway safety. 	
As of December 31, 2004 there were 4,167 active inspection stations located throughout the Commonwealth of
Virginia. There were 13,973 licensed safety inspectors who performed approximately 7,595,000 inspections at
appointed stations during 2004. 	Approximately 21 percent (1,594,950 vehicles) of all vehicles submitted for
inspection were rejected for unsafe components. 	
This Division investigated 2,766 inspection complaints, which resulted in 2,566 instances of disciplinary action
against 291 stations for various classes of offenses and the suspension of 31 inspection stations. 	These
statistics include administrative errors made 	by inspection stations with the majority of errors/complaints
corrected by counseling sessions. 		
Disciplinary action was also taken against 657 safety inspectors, resulting in 118 suspensions. 	
Safety Division personnel conducted 928 business security checks.

Motor Carrier Safety 										
The bureau's Motor Carrier Safety teams ensure that trucks and buses meet safety requirements on Virginia's
highways. Troopers assigned to the Motor Carrier Safety program regularly present lectures to the public and
other interested groups on motor carrier safety and hazardous materials regulations. They also serve as
instructors in criminal justice training seminars. 								
Motor Carrier Safety teams responded to 43 hazardous material spills or incidents in 2004 and conducted 207
post-crash investigations of heavy commercial vehicles involved in accidents. 	Data indicates that during 2004,
troopers conducted 34,747 in-depth inspections on heavy commercial vehicles and 8,528 of these, or 24.5%,
were placed out of service for violations of regulations governing safety equipment and transportation of
hazardous materials. 											
Commercial Vehicle Enforcement 									
The Department has 55 Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Officers whose primary responsibilities include the
inspection and measurement of commercial vehicles that utilize the highways of the Commonwealth. 	During
2004, approximately 16.2 million commercial vehicles passed through Virginia's 13 permanent weigh stations
for inspection. 	Through the inspection of these vehicles and through other enforcement initiatives, Commercial
Vehicle Enforcement Officers issued 73,038 summonses and made 303 criminal arrests. 	This program is vital
to Virginia's overall highway safety program through the protection of roadways from overweight and oversized
vehicles; through assurances that commercial vehicles are mechanically safe to operate on the highways; and
through the validation of all commercial vehicle operators to ensure they are properly licensed to operate a 	
commercial vehicles in the Commonwealth. 								
Aviation Unit 											
The State Police Aviation Unit was formed on January 1, 1984, to provide for the administration and 		
coordination of the Department’s aviation resources. The Unit operates seven helicopters and four airplanes
from four bases located in Lynchburg, Manassas, Abingdon, and Richmond. The Unit’s primary mission is to
provide aircraft for search, rescue, law enforcement and medical evacuation. During its 21 year existence, the
Aviation Unit has recorded 80,114 flight hours responding to 51,390 flight requests. The Department has four
Bell 407 helicopters, an American Eurocopter BK117 and two American Eurocopter B0-105’s. The BK117 and
BO-105’s are primarily used for medical evacuation operations. The Department also has four Cessna 182 	
airplanes. 												
Medical Evacuation 										
The Department operates three helicopter medical evacuation programs that serve Central and Southwest 	
Virginia. These programs provide rapid response, advanced medical procedures, and transportation of critically
injured patients to a level one trauma center. Combined, these programs serve 43 hospitals and the citizens
residing in 59 counties and 34 cities. Med-Flight I began operations on April 1, 1984, and responds to calls for
assistance in a 60-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia. Med-Flight II began operations on January 1, 1987 and
responds to calls for assistance in a 60-mile radius of Abingdon, Virginia. Med-Flight III began operations on
