Survey Methodology for Criminal Victimization 
in the United States, 2005

The survey results contained in this report are based on data 
gathered from residents living throughout the United States, 
including persons living in group quarters, such as dormitories, 
rooming houses, and religious group dwellings. Crew members of 
merchant vessels, Armed Forces personnel living in military 
barracks, and institutionalized persons, such as correctional 
facility inmates, were not included in the scope of this survey.  
Similarly, U.S. citizens residing abroad and foreign visitors 
to this country were excluded.  With these exceptions, 
individuals age 12 or older living in units selected for the 
sample were eligible to be interviewed.

Data Collection

Each housing unit selected for the National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS) remains in the sample for three years, with each 
of seven interviews taking place at 6month intervals. An NCVS 
interviewer's first contact with a housing unit selected for 
the survey is in person.  The interviewer may then conduct 
subsequent interviews by telephone.

To elicit more accurate reporting of incidents, NCVS uses the 
self-respondent method which calls for the direct interviewing 
of each person 12 years or older in the household. An exception 
is made to use proxy interviewing instead of direct interviewing 
for the following three cases:  12- and 13yearold persons when 
a knowledgeable household member insists they not be interviewed 
directly, incapacitated persons, and individuals absent from 
the household during the entire field-interviewing period. In 
the case of temporarily absent household members and persons 
who are physically or mentally incapable of granting interviews, 
interviewers may accept other household members as proxy 
respondents, and in certain situations non-household members may 
provide information for incapacitated persons.

Some interviews were conducted using Computer-Assisted Telephone 
Interviewing (CATI), a data collection mode which involves 
interviewing from centralized facilities and using a computerized 
instrument. In the CATI-eligible part of the sample, all 
interviews are done by telephone whenever possible, except for 
the first interview, which is primarily conducted in person. The 
telephone interviews are conducted by the CATI facilities in 
Hagerstown, Maryland and Tucson, Arizona.

Sample Design and Size

Survey estimates are derived from a stratified, multi-stage 
cluster sample.  The primary sampling units (PSU=s) composing 
the first stage of the sample were counties, groups of counties, 
or large metropolitan areas.  Large PSU's were included in the 
sample automatically and are considered to be self-representing 
(SR) since all of them were selected.  The remaining PSU's, 
called non-self-representing (NSR), because only a subset of 
them was selected, were combined into strata by grouping PSU's 
with similar geographic and demographic characteristics, as 
determined by the 1990 Census. 

The initial 1990 design consisted of 93 SR PSU's and 152 NSR 
strata, with one PSU per stratum selected with probability 
proportionate to population size.  A sample reduction was done 
in October of 1996, reducing the number of NSR PSUs by 42. So, 
the current NCVS sample consists of 110 NSR PSUs. The NCVS 
sample design continued use of both 1980- and 1990-based sample 
through 1997. Beginning in 1998 only 1990-based sample remains.

In the second stage of sampling, each selected stratification 
PSU is divided into four non-overlapping frames (unit, area, 
permit, and group quarters) from which NCVS independently 
selects its sample.  From each selected stratification PSU, 
clusters of approximately four housing units or housing unit 
equivalents are selected from each frame.  For the unit and 
group quarters frames, addresses come from the 1990 Census.  
For the permit frame, addresses come from building permit data 
obtained from building permit offices.  This ensures that 
units built after the 1990 Census are included in the sample.  
For the area frame, sample blocks come from the 1990 Census 
files.  Then, addresses are listed and sampled in the field.  
A new sample, based on addresses drawn from the 2000 census, 
began to be phased in 2005.

The actual number of households and persons interviewed in 
the NCVS sample varies slightly from year to year. Information 
on the number of households and persons interviewed by year 
is presented below. (Also see spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mresp.csv).

Number of households and persons interviewed by year.                 

In order to conduct field interviews, the sample is divided into 
six groups, or rotations, and each group of households are 
interviewed once every six months over a period of three years. 
The initial interview is used to bound the interviews (bounding 
establishes a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes on 
subsequent interviews), but is not used to compute the annual 
estimates.  Each rotation group is further divided into six 
panels. A different panel of households, corresponding to one 
sixth of each rotation group, is interviewed each month during 
the 6-month period.  Because the survey is continuous, newly 
constructed housing units are selected as described, and 
assigned to rotation groups and panels for subsequent 
incorporation into the sample.  A new rotation group enters the 
sample every six months, replacing a group phased out after 
being in the sample for three years. (Also see spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mmon.csv).

Selection of Cases for CATI

Until March 2003, the NCVS sample PSU's fell into three groups 
of CATI usage:  maximum-CATI PSU's, where all the segments in 
the PSU are CATI-eligible; half-CATI PSU's, where half of the 
segments in the PSU are randomly designated to be CATI-eligible; 
and noCATI PSU's, where none of the segments are CATI-eligible.  
The level of CATI usage for each PSU was established with 
concern toward an optimal workload for the field interviewers.  
In the "half-CATI" PSU's, a random sample of about 50% of the 
segments in each PSU is taken and designated as CATI-eligible. 
Beginning March 2003, addresses in all segments became eligible 
for CATI interviewing. CATI cases are interviewed from CATI 
facilities while the other sample cases are interviewed by the 
standard NCVS field procedures.

Collection Year Estimates

The data presented in the tables were collected during the 
calendar year being estimated.  Because of the retrospective 
nature of the survey, the estimates include some incidents 
that actually occurred during the previous year.  Analyses 
comparing the victimization information collected in a calendar 
year (termed a collection year) to that obtained about 
victimizations experienced in the same calendar year (called 
a data year) show only a small difference between the two 
methods. The differences will be greater during periods of 
changing crime rates and less during periods of stable rates.

New Race Information

In 1997 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) introduced 
new guidelines for the collection and reporting of race and 
ethnicity data in government surveys. These methodological 
changes were implemented for all demographic surveys as of 
January 1, 2003. Individuals are now allowed to choose more 
than one race category. In prior years they were asked to 
select a single primary race.

Racial categories presented in these tables now consist of 
the following: white only, black only, other race only 
(American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Pacific Islander if 
only one of these races is given), and two or more races 
(all persons of any race indicating two or more races).  
Individuals are now asked whether they are of Hispanic 
ethnicity before being asked about their race, and are now 
asked directly if they are Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino. 

Estimation Procedure

Annual collection year estimates of the levels and rates of 
victimization are derived by accumulating four quarterly 
estimates.  The weights of all crimes reported during 
interviews in that year are summed, regardless of when the 
crime occurred.  The base for the collection year rate for 
personal crime is the sum of all person weights.  Likewise, 
the base for the property crime rates is the sum of all 
household weights.

The estimation procedure begins with the application of a base 
weight to the data from each individual interviewed.  The base 
weight is the reciprocal of the probability of each unit's 
selection for the sample, and provides a rough measure of the 
population represented by each person in the sample.  Next, an 
adjustment is made to account for households and individuals 
in occupied units who were selected for the survey but 
unavailable for an interview.

In addition to adjusting for unequal probabilities of selection 
and observation, the final weight also includes a ratio 
adjustment to known population totals based on the adjusted 
counts from the 1990 Census.  Specifically, the final person 
weight is the product of the values of the following six 
component weights; the final household weight is the product 
of all components except the within-household non-interview 
adjustment component detailed below:

Probabilities of selection 

* Base weight: the inverse of the sample unit's probability 
of selection. 

* Weighting control factor: adjusts for any subsampling due 
to unexpected events in the field, such as unusually high 
growth in new construction, area segments larger than 
anticipated, and other deviations from the overall stratum 
sampling rate.

Probabilities of observation (Nonresponse)

* Household noninterview adjustment:  adjusts for nonresponse 
at the household level by inflating the weight assigned to 
interviewed households so that they represent themselves and 
noninterviewed households.

* Within-household noninterview adjustment:  adjusts for 
nonresponse at the person level by inflating the weight 
assigned to the interviewed persons so that they represent 
themselves and the missed interviews.

Poststratification ratio adjustment to known population totals

The distribution of the sample population may differ somewhat 
from that of the total population in terms of age, race, sex, 
residence, and other characteristics.  Because of this, two 
stages of ratio estimation are employed to bring the two 
distributions into closer agreement, thereby reducing the 
variability of the sample estimates.

* First-stage factor:  the first stage of ratio estimation is 
applied only to non-self-representing PSU's.  Its purpose is 
to reduce sampling error caused by selecting one PSU to 
represent an entire stratum. It adjusts for race and zone of 
residence differences between the sample non-self-representing 
PSU's and the population non-self-representing PSU's (for 
self-representing PSU's this factor is set to 1). 

* Second-stage factor:  the second stage of ratio estimation 
is applied on an individual basis to bring the distribution of 
individuals in the sample into closer agreement with independent 
current estimates of the population according to age, sex, and 
race characteristics.***Footnote 1: Armed forced personnel who 
are eligible to be interviewed are not included in the second-
stage ratio estimate and receive a factor of 1.*** This factor 
is defined for each person to adjust for the difference between 
weighted counts of persons (using the above five weight 
components) and independent estimates of the number of persons, 
within the defined cells.  These independent estimates are 
projections based on the 2000 Census population controls 
adjusted for the undercount.

For household crimes, the characteristics of the wife in a 
husband-wife household and the characteristics of the head of 
household in other types of households are used to determine 
the ratio adjustment factors.  This procedure is considered 
more precise than simply using the characteristics of the head 
of household since sample coverage is generally better for 
females than males.

For estimates involving incidents rather than victimizations, 
further adjustments are made to those cases where an incident 
involved more than one person. These incidents have more than 
one chance of being included in the sample so each multiple-
victimization is reduced by the number of victims. Thus, if 
two people are victimized during the same incident, the weight
assigned to that incident is the person weight reduced by one-
half so that the incident cannot be counted twice. However, 
the details of the event's outcome as they related to the 
victim are reflected in the survey results. No adjustment is 
necessary in estimating data on household crimes because each
separate crime is defined as involving only one household.

Series Victimizations

A series victimization is defined as six or more similar but 
separate crimes which the victim is unable to recall 
individually or describe in detail to an interviewer. These 
series crimes have been excluded from the tables because the
victims were unable to provide details for each event. Data 
on series crimes are gathered by the calendar quarter(s) of 
occurrence, making it possible to match the time frames used 
in tabulating the data for non-series crimes.

The effect of combining series and non-series crimes, counting
each of the series crimes as a single victimization based on 
the details of the most recent incident, was included in the 
initial release of the 1980 data.***Footnote 2: See Criminal 
Victimization in the United States; 1979-80 Changes, 1973-80 
Trends, BJS Technical Report, NCJ-80838, July 1982.*** The
report showed that victimization counts and rates were higher 
in 1979 and 1980 when the series crimes were added. However, 
rate changes between these two years were basically in the 
same direction and significantly affected the same crimes as 
those affected when only non-series crimes were analyzed.

Accuracy of Estimates

The accuracy of an estimate is a measure of its total error, 
that is, the sum of all the errors affecting the estimate: 
sampling error as well as nonsampling error. 
                                                                 
The sample used for the NCVS is one of a large number of 
possible samples of equal size that could have been obtained 
by using the same sample design and selection procedures. 
Estimates derived from different samples would differ from 
one another due to sampling variability, or sampling error.

The standard error of a survey estimate is a measure of the 
variation among that estimates from all possible samples. 
Therefore, it is a measure of the precision (reliability) 
with which a particular estimate approximates the average 
result of all possible samples. The estimate and its associated
standard error may be used to construct a confidence interval. 
A confidence interval is a range of numbers which has a 
specified probability that the average of all possible samples, 
which is the true unknown value of interest in an unbiased 
design, is contained within the interval. About 68% of the time, 
the survey estimate will differ from the true average by less 
than one standard error. Only 10% of the time will the 
difference be more than 1.6 standard errors, and just one time 
in 100 will it be greater than 2.5 standard errors. A 95% 
confidence interval is the survey estimate plus or minus about 
twice the standard error, thus there is a 95% chance that the 
result of a complete census would fall within the confidence 
interval.

In addition to sampling error, the estimates in this report 
are subject to nonsampling error. While substantial care is 
taken in the NCVS to reduce the sources of nonsampling error 
throughout all the survey operations, by means of a quality 
assurance program, quality controls, operational controls, 
and error-correcting procedures, an unquantified amount of 
nonsampling error remains still.

Major sources of nonsampling error are related to the 
inability of the respondents to recall in detail the crimes 
which occurred during the six months prior to the interview. 
Research based on interviews of victims obtained from police 
files indicates that assault is recalled with the least
accuracy of any crime measured by the NCVS. This may be 
related to the tendency of victims to not report crimes 
committed by offenders who are not strangers, especially if 
they are relatives. In addition, among certain groups, crimes 
which contain elements of assault could be a part of everyday 
life, and are therefore forgotten or not considered important 
enough to mention to a survey interviewer. These recall 
problems may result in an understatement of the actual rate 
of assault. 

Another source of nonsampling error is the inability of some 
respondents to recall the exact month a crime occurred, even 
though it was placed in the correct reference period. This 
error source is partially offset by interviewing monthly and 
using the estimation procedure described earlier. Telescoping 
is another problem in which incidents that occurred before 
the reference period are placed within the period. The effect 
of telescoping is minimized by using the bounding procedure 
previously described. The interviewer is provided with a 
summary of the incidents reported in the preceding interview 
and, if a similar incident is reported, it can be determined 
whether or not it is a new one by discussing it with the 
victim. Events which occurred after the reference period are 
set aside for inclusion with the data from the following 
interview. 

Other sources of nonsampling error can result from other types 
of response mistakes, including errors in reporting incidents 
as crimes, misclassification of crimes, systematic data errors 
introduced by the interviewer, errors made in coding and 
processing the data. Quality control and editing procedures
were used to minimize the number of errors made by the 
respondents and the interviewers.

Since field representatives conducting the interviews usually 
reside in the area in which they interview, the race and 
ethnicity of the field representatives generally matches that 
of the local population. Special efforts are made to further 
match field representatives and the people they interview in 
areas where English is not commonly spoken. About 90% of all
NCVS field representatives are female.

Standard errors measure only those nonsampling errors arising 
from transient factors affecting individual responses 
completely at random (simple response variance); they do not 
reveal any systematic biases in the data. As calculated in 
the NCVS, the standard errors would partially measure 
nonsampling error arising from some of the above sources, such 
as transient memory errors, or accidental errors in recording 
or coding answers, for example.

Computation and Application of Standard Errors

Deriving standard errors which are applicable to a wide 
variety of items and which can be prepared at a moderate cost 
requires a number of approximations. Therefore, three 
generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters
(identified as "a," "b," and "c") were developed for use in 
calculating standard errors. The parameters provide an 
indication of the order of magnitude of the standard errors 
rather than the precise standard error for any specific item. 
For each year, there are four sets of parameters for use
with a different sets of estimates, as described below. (Also
see spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mpar.csv, 
for values).

For year-to-year comparisons, an additional parameter, (rho) 
is used to account for year-to-year correlation.

Year-to-Year Correlation Between Estimates

Because of the year-to-year overlap in the sample, the same
households and persons contribute to annual estimates for 
different years. This year-to-year correlation between 
estimates is measured by rho. In general:

If estimates are uncorrelated, rho = 0. Hence, omitting the 
term containing rho in the formula will provide an accurate 
standard error for the difference between uncorrelated 
estimates. On the other hand, if the two estimates have
a strong positive correlation, omitting the last term will 
cause overestimation of the true standard error. (Also see 
spreadsheet at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/
2005/cv05myy.csv, for values).

Parameter set #1 is used for the overall person crime 
estimates. These are the person crime estimates by crime 
category for the whole population, not disaggregated by any 
victim, offender, or incident characteristics, nor any
variable related to reporting to police.

Parameter set #2 is used for the person crime domain estimates.  
These are the person crime estimates disaggregated by victim, 
offender, or incident characteristics, or any variable related 
to reporting to police.

Parameter set #3 is used for the property crime estimates for 
the whole population. These are the property crime estimates 
by crime category for the whole population, not disaggregated 
by any household characteristics, nor any variable related to 
reporting to police.

Parameter set #4 is used for the property crime domain 
estimates. These are the property crime estimates 
disaggregated by household characteristics, or any variable 
related to reporting to police.

For the statistic from Table 1 that corresponds to the crime 
category "all crimes" (i.e., person and property crimes 
together), parameter set #3 should be used.  When the person 
and property estimates are combined (i.e., all crimes) and 
disaggregated by victim, household, incident characteristics, 
as well as any variable related to reporting to police, 
parameter set #4 should be used for the best estimate of the 
corresponding variance.  

Direct variances were calculated using the balanced repeated 
replication (BRR)method. The estimates and their corresponding 
variances were fit to the standard 3parameter model to obtain 
the value of the parameters.

The following examples explain the procedures based upon the 
2005 data. The formulas used to calculate the variances are 
available in accompanying spreadsheets, Sigma 1 (See 
spreadsheet at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/
2005/cv05msig1.xls, for values) and Sigma 2 (See spreadsheet 
at: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/
cv05msig2.xls, for values). For each example, a spreadsheet 
using the formulas is also provided. 

Example 1. See spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mex1.
xls, for values. This example shows how to calculate a 
confidence interval around the count of a personal crime, 
the number of completed robberies in 2005. It uses
parameter set #1 because the crime is not disaggregated by 
any characteristics such as age or race. The Sigma 1 
spreadsheet was used to calculate confidence intervals 
around the counts. 

The example from Table 1 in 2005 shows 415,320 completed 
robberies. The confidence intervals were calculated by 
entering the appropriate data into the Sigma 1 spreadsheet. 
Using the parameters for overall person crime estimates
(Parameter set #1), the following values were entered:

   "a" parameter = -0.00018335
   "b" parameter =  3,946
   "c" parameter =  2.615
 
The population base of 415,320 completed robberies was also 
entered.  

The results show that the 95% confidence interval around the 
estimated number of robbery victimizations is about equal to 
415,320 plus or minus twice (1.96) the standard error, or 
plus or minus 94,144: a confidence interval of 321,176 to 
509,464.

Example 2. See spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mex2.
xls, for values. This example shows how to calculate a 
confidence interval around a rate for a personal crime by 
a particular variable, the rate of robberies for persons age
20 through 24 in 2005. It uses parameter set #2 because the 
crime is disaggregated by the characteristic of age. The
Sigma 2 spreadsheet was used to calculate confidence 
intervals around the rates.

The example from Table 3 in 2005 shows a robbery rate of 5.5 
per 1,000 persons age 20 through 24. The confidence intervals 
were calculated by entering the appropriate data into the 
Sigma 2 spreadsheet. Using the parameters for person domain 
estimates (Parameter set #2), the following values were 
entered:

      "b" parameter = 4,074
      "c" parameter = 3.137

The population base of 20,363,570 age 20 through 24 and the 
rate of 5.5 for robberies per 1,000 persons age 20 through 
24 were also entered.  

The results show that the 95% confidence interval around the 
estimated rate of robbery victimizations for persons age 20 
through 24 is equal to 5.5 plus or minus twice (1.96) the 
standard error, or plus or minor 2.3: a confidence interval 
of 3.2  to 7.8 per 1,000 persons age 20 through 24.  

Example 3. See spreadsheet at:
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/sheets/cvus/2005/cv05mex3.xls, 
for values. This example shows how to determine if the 
differences between two rates or percentages are statistically 
significant. This example compares the rates for males and 
females for aggravated assault. It uses parameter set #2 
because the crime is disaggregated by the characteristic of 
gender. The Sigma 2 spreadsheet was used to determine if the 
differences in rates were statistically significant.

The example from Table 2 in 2005 shows an aggravated assault 
rate of 5.6 per 1,000 males (age 12 or older) and 3.1 per 
1,000 females (age 12 or older). Using the parameters for 
person domain estimates (Parameter set #2), the following 
values were entered:

       "b" parameter = 4,074
       "c" parameter = 3.137

For males (the first line for set #1), the population base of 
118,937,730 males and the rate of 5.6 aggravated assaults per 
1,000 males were entered. For females (the second line for set 
#2), the population base of 125,555,710 females and the rate 
of 3.1 aggravated assaults per 1,000 females were also entered.  

The results show that by comparing set #1 with set #2, the 
differences between males and females for aggravated assault 
in 2005 is statistically significant. 

The spreadsheet shows the ratio of a difference to the standard 
error or the "z" score, which is associated with a given 
statistical level of significance. A ratio with an absolute 
value of 1.96 or greater indicates that the difference is 
significant at the 95% confidence level (or greater); a ratio
with a absolute value between 1.65 and 1.96 indicates the 
difference is significant at a confidence level between 90% 
and 95%; a ratio with an absolute value less than 1.65 denotes 
a confidence level less than 90%. As indicated on the 
spreadsheet, the ratio of the difference (.0025) to the 
standard error (.00067) is 3.7. Thus, the spreadsheet 
indicates that the differences between the rates for 
aggravated assault for males and females was statistically 
significant at greater than the 95% confidence level.  

In BJS reports, findings are normally significant at the 95% 
confidence level. If the finding is significant at the 90% 
confidence level, words such as "some evidence" are used. The 
standards used are explained in the methodology section of 
each report.

from businesses or farms, pensions, interest, dividends, rent, 
and any other form of monetary income. 

Aggravated assault - Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, 
regardless of whether or not an injury occurred and attack 
without a weapon when serious injury results. 

With injury - An attack without a weapon when serious injury 
results or an attack with a weapon involving any injury. 
Serious injury includes broken bones, lost teeth, internal 
injuries, loss of consciousness, and any unspecified injury 
requiring two or more days of hospitalization. 

Threatened with a weapon - Threat or attempted attack by an 
offender armed with a gun, knife, or other object used as a 
weapon, not resulting in victim injury.
 
Assault - An unlawful physical attack or threat of attack. 
Assaults may be classified as aggravated or simple. Rape, 
attempted rape, and sexual assaults are excluded from this 
category, as well as robbery and attempted robbery. The
severity of assaults ranges from minor threat to incidents 
which are nearly fatal. 

Burglary ( also Household burglary) - Unlawful or forcible 
entry or attempted entry of a residence. This crime usually, 
but not always, involves theft. The illegal entry may be by 
force, such as breaking a window or slashing a screen, or 
may be without force by entering through an unlocked door 
or an open window. As long as the person entering has no 
legal right to be present in the structure a burglary has 
occurred. Furthermore, the structure need not be the
house itself for a burglary to take place; illegal entry of 
a garage, shed, or any other structure on the premises also 
constitutes household burglary. If breaking and entering 
occurs in a hotel or vacation residence, it is still
classified as a burglary for the household whose member or 
members were staying there at the time the entry occurred. 

Completed burglary - A form of burglary in which a person 
who has no legal right to be present in the structure 
successfully gains entry to a residence, by use of force, 
or without force.
  
Forcible entry - A form of completed burglary in which 
force is used to gain entry to a residence. Some examples 
include breaking a window or slashing a screen.
 
Unlawful entry without force - A form of completed burglary 
committed by someone having no legal right to be on the 
premises, even though no force is used. 

Attempted forcible entry - A form of burglary in which force 
is used in an attempt to gain entry.

Collection year - The set of victimizations reported to NCVS 
in interviews conducted during the same calendar year. This 
set may include victimizations which occurred in the previous 
calendar year, due to the retrospective nature of the NCVS 
interview. Collection year data are used in tables beginning 
in 1996.  See "Data year."

Commercial crimes - Crimes against commercial establishments 
of any type are not included in the survey. Commercial 
establishments include stores, restaurants, businesses, 
service stations, medical offices or hospitals, or other 
similar establishments. For victimizations occurring in 
commercial establishments, the crime is included or not 
included depending upon whether the survey respondent was 
threatened or harmed in some way or personal property was 
taken.

Crime classification - Victimizations and incidents are 
classified based upon detailed characteristics of the event 
provided by the respondent. Neither victims nor interviewers 
classify crimes at the time of interview. During data
processing, a computer program classifies each event into one 
type of crime, based upon the entries on a number of items on 
the survey questionnaire. This ensures that similar events 
will be classified using a standard procedure. The glossary 
definition for each crime indicates the major characteristics
required to be so classified. If an event can be classified 
as more than one type of crime, a hierarchy is used which 
classifies the crime according to the most serious event that 
occurred. The hierarchy is: rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft.
 
Data year - The set of victimizations reported to NCVS all of 
which occurred within the same calendar year. For all years 
prior to 1996, Criminal Victimization in the United States 
tables are based upon data year. Beginning in 1996 and later 
years, tables are based upon collection year. See "Collection 
Year."

Ethnicity - A classification based on Hispanic culture and 
origin, regardless of race.  Persons are asked directly if 
they are Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino before being asked 
about their racial category.

Head of household - A classification which defines one and only 
one person in each housing unit as the head. Head of household 
implies that the person rents or owns (or is in the process of 
buying), the housing unit. The head of household must be at 
least 18, unless all members of the household are under 18, or 
the head is married to someone 18 or older. 

Hispanic - A person who describes himself as Mexican-American, 
Chicano, Mexican, Mexicano, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central 
American, South American, or from some other Spanish culture 
or origin, regardless of race. 

Household - A person or group of people meeting either of the 
following criteria: (1) people whose usual place of residence 
is the same housing unit, even if they are temporarily absent: 
(2) people staying in a housing unit who have no usual place 
of residence elsewhere. 

Household Burglary - See burglary.

Incident - A specific criminal act involving one or more 
victims and offenders. For example, if two people are robbed 
at the same time and place, this is classified as two robbery 
victimizations but only one robbery incident. 

Marital status - Every person is assigned to one of the 
following classifications: (1) married, which includes 
persons in common-law unions and those who are currently 
living apart for reasons other than marital discord 
(employment, military service, etc.); (2) separated or 
divorced, which includes married persons who are legally 
separated and those who are not living together because of 
marital discord; (3) widowed; and (4) never married, which 
includes persons whose marriages have been annulled and 
those who are living together and not in a common-law union.
 
Metropolitan area - See "Metropolitan Statistical Area." 

Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) - The Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) defines this as a population nucleus of 
50,000 or more, generally consisting of a city and its 
immediate suburbs, along with adjacent communities having a 
high degree of economic and social integration with the
nucleus. MSA's are designated by counties, the smallest 
geographic units for which a wide range of statistical data 
can be attained. However, in New England, MSA's are designated 
by cities and towns since these subcounty units are of great 
local significance and considerable data is available for 
them. Currently, an area is defined as an MSA if it meets 
one of two standards: 
 
(1) A city has a population of at least 50,000; (2) the Census 
Bureau defines an urbanized area of at least 50,000 people 
with a total metropolitan population of at least 100,000 (or 
75,000 in New England). The Census Bureau's definition of 
urbanized areas, data on commuting to work, and the strength 
of the economic and social ties between the surrounding 
counties and the central city determine which counties not 
containing a main city are included in an MSA. For New England, 
MSA's are determined by a core area and related cities and 
towns, not counties. A metropolitan statistical area may 
contain more than one city of 50,000 and may cross State lines. 

Motor vehicle - An automobile, truck, motorcycle, or any other 
motorized vehicle legally allowed on public roads and highways.
 
Motor vehicle theft - Stealing or unauthorized taking of a 
motor vehicle, including attempted thefts.
 
Completed motor vehicle theft - The successful taking of a 
vehicle by an unauthorized person.

Attempted motor vehicle theft - The unsuccessful attempt by 
an unauthorized person to take a vehicle.
 
Multiple offenders - Two or more persons inflicting some 
direct harm to a victim. The victim-offender relationship is 
determined by the offender with the closest relationship to 
the victim. The following list ranks the different relationships 
from closest to most distant: spouse, exspouse, parent, child, 
other relative, nonrelative wellknown person, casual 
acquaintance, or stranger (See Nonstranger and Stranger). 

Non-Hispanic - Persons who report their culture or origin as 
something other than "Hispanic" as defined above. This 
distinction is made regardless of race. 

Non-stranger - A classification of a crime victim's 
relationship to the offender. An offender who is either 
related to, well known to, or casually acquainted with the 
victim is a nonstranger. For crimes with more than one
offender, if any of the offenders are nonstrangers, then the 
group of offenders as a whole is classified as nonstranger. 
This category only applies to crimes which involve contact 
between the victim and the offender; the distinction is not 
made for crimes of theft since victims of this offense rarely 
see the offenders. 

Offender - The perpetrator of a crime; this term usually 
applies to crimes involving contact between the victim and 
the offender. 

Offense - A crime. When referring to personal crimes, the term 
can be used to refer to both victimizations and incidents.
 
Personal crimes - Rape, sexual assault, personal robbery, 
assault, purse snatching and pocket picking. This category 
includes both attempted and completed crimes.  

Place of occurrence of crime - The location at which a crime 
occurred, as specified by the victim. Survey measures of 
crimes occurring in commercial establishments, restaurants, 
nightclubs, public transportation and other similar places 
include only those crimes involving NCVS measured crimes
against persons, not the establishments. Crimes against 
commercial establishments and other places are not measured 
by the survey.
 
Property crimes - Property crimes including burglary, motor 
vehicle theft, or theft. This category includes both attempted 
and completed crimes.
 
Purse snatching/Pocket picking - Theft or attempted theft of 
property or cash directly from the victim by stealth, without 
force or threat of force. 

Race - For this survey respondents self identify with one or 
more racial categories. Racial categories for this report are 
white only, black only, and other race only. The "other" 
category is composed of Asian Pacific Islanders, and American 
Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos, if only one of these races is
given. Persons reporting two or more races are included in 
the category of "more than one race".  The race of the head 
of household is use for computing household crime demographics. 

Rape - Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological 
coercion as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse 
means vaginal, anal or oral penetration by the offender(s). 
This category also includes incidents where the penetration is 
from a foreign object such as a bottle. Includes attempted
rapes, male as well as female victims and both heterosexual 
and homosexual rape. Attempted rape includes verbal threats 
of rape. 

Rate of victimization - see "Victimization rate." 

Region - The States have been divided into four groups or 
census regions:

or without a weapon, resulting in injury. 

Rural area - A place not located inside the Metropolitan 
Statistical Area. This category includes a variety of 
localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural areas to 
cities with populations less than 50,000. 

Sample - The set of housing units selected by the U. S. Census 
Bureau to be interviewed for the survey. All occupants of 
the household age 12 or older are interviewed. See 
methodology for sample inclusions and exclusions. 

Series - Six or more similar but separate events, which the 
respondent is unable to describe separately in detail to an 
interviewer.

Sexual assault - A wide range of victimizations, separate 
from rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or 
attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact 
between victim and offender. Sexual assaults may or may not 
involve force and include such things as grabbing or fondling.
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. 

Simple assault - Attack without a weapon resulting either in 
no injury, minor injury (for example, bruises, black eyes, 
cuts, scratches or swelling) or in undetermined injury 
requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes 
attempted assault without a weapon. 

With minor injury - An attack without a weapon resulting in 
such injuries as bruises, black eyes, cuts or in undetermined 
injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. 

Without injury - An attempted assault without a weapon not 
resulting in injury.
 
Stranger - A classification of the victim's relationship to 
the offender for crimes involving direct contact between the 
two. Incidents are classified as involving strangers if the 
victim identifies the offender as a stranger, did not see or 
recognize the offender, or knew the offender only by sight. 
Crimes involving multiple offenders are classified as 
involving nonstrangers if any of the offenders was a 
nonstranger. Since victims of theft without contact rarely 
see the offender, no distinction is made between strangers 
and nonstrangers for this crime. 

Suburban areas - A county or counties containing a central 
city, plus any contiguous counties that are linked socially 
and economically to the central city. On data tables, 
suburban areas are categorized as those portions of
metropolitan areas situated "outside central cities." 

Tenure - The NCVS recognizes two forms of household tenancy: 
(1) owned, which includes dwellings that are mortgaged, and 
(2) rented, which includes rentfree quarters belonging to a 
party other than the occupants, and situations where rental 
payments are in kind or services. 

Theft - Completed or attempted theft of property or cash 
without personal contact. Incidents involving theft of 
property from within the sample household would classify as 
theft if the offender has a legal right to be in the house 
(such as a maid, delivery person, or guest). If the offender 
has no legal right to be in the house, the incident would 
classify as a burglary. 

Completed - To successfully take without permission property 
or cash without personal contact between the victim and 
offender.  

Attempted - To unsuccessfully attempt to take property or 
cash without personal contact.
 
Urban areas - The largest city (or grouping of cities) in a 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (see definition of 
Metropolitan Statistical Area). 

Victim - The recipient of a criminal act, usually used in 
relation to personal crimes, but also applicable to 
households. 

Victimization - A crime as it affects one individual person 
or household. For personal crimes, the number of 
victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. 
The number of victimizations may be greater than the number 
of incidents because more than one person may be victimized 
during an incident. Each crime against a household is assumed 
to involve a single victim, the affected household.
 
Victimization rate - A measure of the occurrence of 
victimizations among a specified population group. 

For personal crimes, this is based on the number of 
victimizations per 1,000 residents age 12 or older. For 
household crimes, the victimization rates are calculated 
using the number of incidents per 1,000 households. 

Victimize - To commit a crime against a person or household.

Violence, crimes of - Rape, sexual assault, personal robbery 
or assault. This category includes both attempted and 
completed crimes. It does not include purse snatching and 
pocket picking. Murder is not measured by the NCVS because
of an inability to question the victim. 

Completed violence - The sum of all completed rapes, sexual 
assaults, robberies, and assaults. See individual crime 
types for definition of completed crimes. 

Attempted/threatened violence - The unsuccessful attempt of 
rape, sexual assault, personal robbery or assault. Includes 
attempted attacks or sexual assaults by means of verbal 
threats. See individual crime types for definition of 
attempted crimes.
