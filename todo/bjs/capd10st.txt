Persons age 12 or older who had disabilities
experienced an estimated 567,000 nonfatal
violent crimes in 2010 (table 1). This number
represents a 25% decrease from 2009, when persons
with disabilities experienced more than 753,000
nonfatal violent crimes. Nonfatal violent crimes
include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault. Between 2008 and 2009,
no measurable difference occurred in the levels of
violent crime against persons with disabilities.

The findings in this report are based on the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), a household
survey that collects data on the civilian resident U.S.
population (excluding those living in institutions).
The NCVS defines disability as a sensory, physical,
mental, or emotional condition lasting 6 months
or longer and causing difficulty in activities of daily
living. Disabilities are classified according to six
limitations:

* Hearing limitation entails deafness or serious difficulty
hearing.

* Vision limitation is blindness or serious difficulty
seeing, even when wearing glasses.

* Cognitive limitation includes serious difficulty in
concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a
physical, mental, or emotional condition.

* Ambulatory limitation is difficulty walking or climbing
stairs.

* Self-care limitation is a condition that causes difficulty
dressing or bathing.

* Independent living limitation is a physical, mental,
or emotional condition that impedes doing errands alone, such
as visiting a doctor or shopping.

The NCVS adopted survey questions from the U.S. Census
Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) to identify
respondents with disabilities. Data from the ACS were used to
estimate victimization rates for persons with and without
disabilities. NCVS does not identify persons in the general
population with disabilities. The Methodology further details
data sources and data limitations.

Statistical tables in this report detail nonfatal violent
victimization against persons with disabilities. The tables
detail the level and rates of victimization of persons with
and without disabilities, describes the types of
disabilities, and compares victim and crime characteristics.
                              

Age-adjusted rates of violent victimizations

Direct comparisons of the victimization rate between persons
with and without disabilities without taking into account the
differences in age distributions between the two populations
can be misleading. The age distribution of persons with
disabilities differs considerably from that of persons
without disabilities, and violent crime victimization rates
vary significantly with age. To compare rates of violent
victimization by disability status, an age adjustment method
was used to handle the differences in age distributions of
persons with disabilities and without disabilities. According
to the ACS, persons with disabilities are generally older
than persons without disabilities. For example, in 2009 about
41% of persons with disabilities were age 65 or older,
compared to 11% of persons without disabilities. The age
adjustment standardizes the rate of violence for persons with
disabilities to show what the rate against them would be if
they had the same age distribution of persons without
disabilities.

In generating the age-adjusted rates, unadjusted rates of
violent crime by age group were calculated by dividing the
number of violent incidents against persons with disabilities
in a specific age group by the number of persons with
disabilities in that age group. The proportion of the
particular age group among the number of persons without
disabilities are calculated and multiplied by the unadjusted
rate for that age group. This is done for each age group and
the results are summed, generating the age-adjusted rate.
Both age-specific rates of violent crime and age distribution
of the population contribute to the age-adjusted rates
presented in this report.

In 2010, the unadjusted rate of violent victimization was
similar for both populations (16 violent victimizations per
1,000 for persons age 12 or older with disabilities and 15
violent victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older
without disabilities). However, the age-adjusted rate of
violent crime against persons with disabilities (28 violent
victimizations per 1,000 persons) was higher than the rate
for persons without disabilities (15 violent victimizations
per 1,000 persons). (See Methodology for more information.)

Data limitations

The NCVS does not survey persons living in institutions,
such as adult correctional facilities, nursing facilities, or
patient hospice facilities. According to the ACS, about 1.6
million persons age 65 or older living in institutions had
disabilities. Because persons in these facilities would not
be covered in the survey, estimates of violence against them
are not counted. In addition, certain aspects of the NCVS
design may also contribute to an underestimation of violence
against persons with disabilities. For details, see
Limitations of the Estimates in Methodology.

Disability population in the U.S.

In 2009, according to the ACS, an estimated 14% of the
U.S. population age 12 or older living outside of
institutions had a disability. Characteristics of the
population with and without disabilities are compared in
appendix table 13. Among the noninstitutionalized persons
with disabilities, 47% were male and 53% were female. Whites
accounted for 77% of the population with disabilities, blacks
14%, other races 7%, and multiple races 2%. About 10% were
Hispanic. Slightly more than 68% of the population with
disabilities was age 50 or older, compared to 32% in the
population without disabilities. The sex, race, Hispanic
origin and age distributions of persons with a disability
living outside of institutions did not change substantially
between 2008 and 2009, as measured by the ACS. The 2010
population estimates for persons with a disability were based
on the 2009 population distributions. (See Methodology for
more information.)

Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act (Public Law
105-301), 1998 

The Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act mandates
that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) include
statistics on crimes against people with disabilities and
the characteristics of the victims of those crimes. The act
was designed "to increase public awareness of the plight
of victims of crime with developmental disabilities, to
collect data to measure the magnitude of the problem, and to
develop strategies to address the safety and justice needs of
victims of crime with developmental disabilities." Section 5
of the act directed the Department of Justice to include
statistics relating to "the nature of crimes against people
with developmental disabilities; and the specific
characteristics of the victims of those crimes" in the NCVS.

This is the third report in the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS)series on crime against people with disabilities. The
first two reports in this series, Crime Against People with
Disabilities, 2007 (NCJ 227814) and Crime Against People with
Disabilities, 2008 (NCJ 231328), are available on the BJS
Website. Because of changes in the questionnaire, comparisons
between 2007 data and later years should not be made. (See
Methodology for more information on changes to the NCVS and
ACS questionnaires.)

Summary Findings

Violent crime by type of crime

* In 2010, the age-adjusted violent victimization rate for
persons with disabilities (28 violent victimizations per
1,000) was almost twice the rate among persons without
disabilities (15 violent victimizations per 1,000) (table 2).

* In 2010, serious violence (rape/sexual assault, robbery,
and aggravated assault) accounted for about 50% of violence
against persons with disabilities, up from 36% in 2009.
This increase was driven primarily by a decline in simple
assaults (down 41%) rather than an increase in serious
violence.

* Between 2009 and 2010, the number of violent
victimizations against persons with disabilities dropped
25%.

* In 2010, the age-adjusted rate of serious violent
victimization (rape/sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated
assault) was 16 per 1,000 persons with disabilities,
compared to 5 per 1,000 for persons without disabilities.

* From 2008 to 2010, the age-adjusted rate of violent crime
against persons with disabilities decreased from 40 per
1,000 to 28 per 1,000. By comparison, the rate of violent
crime against persons without disabilities decreased from
20 per 1,000 in 2008 to about 15 per 1,000 in 2010.

* In 2010, the age-adjusted rate of simple assault against
persons with disabilities was 12 per 1,000, compared to a
rate of 10 per 1,000 for persons without disabilities.

Violent crime rates by victim characteristics

Age

* In 2010, among persons age 12 to 15, persons with
disabilities had an unadjusted rate of violent victimization
(61 per 1,000) that was at least twice that of persons
without disabilities (23 per 1,000) (table 3).

* Between 2008 and 2009, the violent crime rate for persons
age 12 to 15 with disabilities declined from 135 per 1,000
to 79 per 1,000.

* In 2010, the unadjusted rate of violent crime against
persons age 65 or older did not differ by disability status,
about 2 to 3 victimizations per 1,000 persons.

* From 2009 to 2010, unadjusted violent victimization rates
declined for persons age 25 to 34 with disabilities (from 51
per 1,000 to 26 per 1,000).

* From 2009 to 2010, among persons without disabilities,
the violent crime rates decreased for persons age 12 to 15
(from 35 per 1,000 to 23 per 1,000) and decreased slightly
for persons age 35 to 49 (from 15 per 1,000 to 13 per
1,000).

Sex

* In 2010, for both males and females the age-adjusted rate
of violent crime was greater for those with disabilities than
the rate against those without disabilities. The rate for
males with disabilities was 23 per 1,000, compared to 16
per 1,000 for males without disabilities; for females with
disabilities the rate was 26 per 1,000, compared to 15 per
1,000 for females without disabilities (table 4).

* Among persons with disabilities, females with disabilities
(26 per 1,000) had a slightly higher age-adjusted rate
than males with disabilities (23 per 1,000) in 2010;
among persons without disabilities, males (16 per 1,000)
and females (15 per 1,000) had similar rates of violent
victimization.

Race and Hispanic origin

* From 2009 to 2010, among persons with disabilities, the
age-adjusted rates of violent victimization decreased for
whites (from 38 per 1,000 to 23 per 1,000), blacks (45 per
1,000 to 23 per 1,000), Hispanics (33 per 1,000 to 24 per
1,000), and non-Hispanics (38 per 1,000 to 24 per 1,000).

* In 2010, among whites, other races, and persons of two or
more races, those with disabilities had higher age-adjusted
violent victimization rates than those without disabilities:
whites (23 per 1,000 compared to 15 per 1,000), persons of
other races* (22 per 1,000 compared to 6 per 1,000), and
persons of two or more races (93 per 1,000 compared to 22
per 1,000).

* Among blacks, the age-adjusted rate of violent
victimization did not differ by disability status in 2010 (23
per 1,000 blacks with disabilities compared to 23 per 1,000
blacks without disabilities).

* In 2010, there was no difference in the age-adjusted rate
of violent crime against whites (23 per 1,000), blacks (23
per 1,000), and persons of other races 
Footnote * Persons of other races include American Indians,
Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific
Islanders.***(22 per 1,000) with disabilities.

* In 2010, Hispanics and non-Hispanics with disabilities
had the same age-adjusted violent victimization rate (24
victimizations per 1,000 persons), and Hispanics and
non-Hispanics without disabilities had the same rate (15
victimizations per 1,000 persons).

Types of disabilities

* In 2010, among the disability types measured, persons
with cognitive disabilities had the highest rate of violent
victimization (30 per 1,000) (table 5).

* In 2009 and 2010, there were no measurable differences by
sex in the rates of violent crime by disability type (table
6).

Among males with disabilities--

* The rate of violent victimization for males with vision
disabilities increased slightly, from 17 per 1,000 in 2008
to 29 per 1,000 in 2009. From 2009 to 2010, the violent
victimization rate for males with vision disabilities
decreased slightly to 18 per 1,000.

* For males with ambulatory disabilities, the rate of violent
victimization increased from 11 per 1,000 in 2008 to 20
per 1,000 in 2009. There was no measurable change in the
violent victimization rate from 2009 to 2010 (16 per 1,000).

Among females with disabilities--

* Between 2008 and 2009, the rates of violent victimization
against females with hearing disabilities (19 per 1,000
compared to 14 per 1,000) did not vary, but it decreased
slightly from 2009 to 2010 (8 per 1,000).

* There was no measurable difference between the 2008 and
2009 rates of violent victimization against females with
vision disabilities (19 per 1,000 to 22 per 1,000); however,
the rate decreased slightly from 2009 to 2010 (13 per
1,000).

* For females with ambulatory disabilities, the rate of
violent victimization increased slightly from 2008 to 2009
(14 per 1,000 to 21 per 1,000) and decreased from 2009 to
2010 (11 per 1,000).

* For females with self-care disabilities, the rate of
violent victimization increased from 2008 to 2009 (9 per
1,000 to 18 per 1,000). There was no measurable change in the
2009 and 2010 (13 per 1,000) rate of violent victimization
against persons with self-care disabilities.

Victim/offender relationship

* In 2010, offenders were strangers to the victim in 33% of
violent victimizations against persons with disabilities,
compared to 41% of violent victimizations against persons
without disabilities (table 7).

* In 2010, intimate partner violence accounted for 13% of
violence against persons with disabilities, similar to the
percentage of violence against persons without disabilities
(14%).

* In 2010, persons with disabilities (40%) were more likely
than persons without disabilities (31%) to be attacked
by persons well known to them or who were casual
acquaintances of the victim.

* The percentage of violence against persons with
disabilities that was committed by intimate partners rose
from 15% in 2008 to 23% in 2009 and declined to 13% in 2010;
for persons without disabilities, this percentage remained
relatively consistent, from 13% in 2008 to 14% in 2010.

* While the percentage of violence against persons with
disabilities committed by persons well known to them or
casual acquaintances of the victim did not change
significantly between 2008 and 2009, the percentage increased
slightly from 31% in 2009 to 40% in 2010. The percentage did
not significantly change from 2008 (32%) to 2010 (31%) for
persons without disabilities.

* In 2010, in about 17% of violence against persons with
disabilities, the victim reported that they believed they had
been targeted due to their disabilities (not shown in table).
Victim resistance

* In 2010, victims with disabilities (55%) were as likely
as victims without disabilities (57%) to use any type of
resistance during a violent crime, including threatening or
attacking the offender (table 8).

* Between 2009 and 2010, there were no measureable
differences in the percentage of victims in either disability
status who resisted their perpetrator; however, between
2008 and 2009, there was an increase in the percentage of
victims with disabilities that resisted the offender.

* In 2010, about half of victims with disabilities (46%) or
without (51%)disabilities used nonconfrontational tactics
(such as yelling at offender or cooperating with offender)
in resisting their offender.

* From 2008 to 2010, the percentage of violent crime victims
with and without disabilities who used nonconfrontational
tactics decreased slightly.

Offender weapon possession

* In 2010, victimizations against persons with disabilities
(30%) were more likely than victimizations against persons
without disabilities (21%) to involve an armed offender
(table 9).

* The offender was armed with a firearm in about 14%
of victimizations involving persons with disabilities,
compared to 8% of victimizations against those without
disabilities in 2010.

* Among persons with disabilities, the percentage of
violence in which the victim faced an armed offender
increased from 20% in 2008 to 30% in 2010.

Victim injury

* In 2010, about a third of victims with and without
disabilities suffered an injury during the event (table 10).

*Persons with disabilities who were injured during a violent
victimization (20%) were more likely than persons without
disabilities (12%) to receive medical treatment in 2010.

* The percentage of violence against persons with
disabilities in which the victim was injured remained steady
from 2008 (27%) to 2010 (33%).

* The percentage of violence in which the injured victims
with disabilities received medical treatment increased from
11% in 2008 to 20% in 2010.

Police notification and use of non-police victim service
agencies

* In 2010, about 41% of the violent victimizations against
persons with disabilities were reported to police, compared
to about 53% of victimizations against persons without
disabilities (table 11).

* In 2010, robbery (39%) and aggravated assault (40%)
against persons with disabilities were less likely to be
reported to police than similar crimes against persons
without disabilities (63% reported for robbery and 65% for
aggravated assault).

* Police notification of serious violence against persons
with disabilities declined from 62% in 2008 to 42% in
2010, while police notification of serious violence against
persons without disabilities remained relatively steady
(58% in 2008 compared to 62% in 2010).

* In 2010, about 9% of victimizations of persons with
disabilities used victim service agencies other than the
police (table 12).
