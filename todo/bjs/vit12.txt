Victims of Identity Theft, 2012

Erika Harrell, Ph.D. and Lynn Langton, Ph.D.,                            
BJS Statisticians

Approximately 16.6 million persons or 7% of all U.S. 
residents age 16 or older, were victims of one or more 
incidents of identity theft on 2012 (figure 1). Among 
identity theft victims, existing bank (37%) or credit card 
accounts (40%) were the most common types of misused 
information.

This report uses data from the 2012 Identity Theft 
Supplement (ITS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS). From January to June 2012, the ITS collected data 
from persons who experienced one or more attempted or 
successful incidents of identity theft during the 12 months 
preceding their interview.

Identity theft victims are defined as persons age 16 or 
older who experienced one or more of the following 
incidents:

* unauthorized use or attempted use of an existing account, 
such as a credit or debit card, checking, savings, 
telephone, online, or insurance account (referred to as 
fraud or misuse of an existing account).

* unauthorized use or attempted use of personal information 
to open a new account, such as a credit or debit card, 
telephone, checking, savings, loan, or mortgage account 
(referred to as fraud or misuse of a new account).
* misuse of personal information for a fraudulent purpose, 
such as getting medical care, a job, or government benefits; 
renting an apartment or house; or providing false 
information to law enforcement when charged with a crime or 
traffic violation (referred to as fraud or misuse of 
personal information).

Highlights
**********

* The purpose of this report is to describe the prevalence 
of identity theft, its victims, and the characteristics and 
effects of this crime. The 2012 Identity Theft Supplement 
(ITS) of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
provided the data for this report. 

* About 7% of persons age 16 or older were victims of 
identity theft in 2012.
 
* The majority of identity theft incidents (85%) involved 
the fraudulent use of existing account information, such as 
credit card or bank account information.

* Victims who had personal information used to open a new 
account or for other fraudulent purposes were more likely 
than victims of existing account fraud to experience 
financial, credit, and relationship problems and severe 
emotional distress.

* About 14% of identity theft victims experienced out-of-
pocket losses of $1 or more. Of these victims, about half 
suffered losses of less than $100.

* Over half of identity theft victims who were able to 
resolve any associated problems did so in a day or less. 

* About 36% of identity theft victims reported moderate or 
severe emotional distress as a result of the incident.

* Direct and indirect losses from identity theft totaled 
$24.7 billion in 2012.

* Fourteen percent of persons age 16 or older have 
experienced identity theft during their lives.
********************************************************

This report details the number, percentage, and demographic 
characteristics of victims who reported one or more 
incidents of identity theft during a 12-month period. It 
focuses on the most recent incident experienced to describe 
victim characteristics and victim responses to identity 
theft. It describes how the victim discovered the crime; 
financial losses and other consequences of identity theft, 
including the amount of time victims spent resolving 
associated problems; reporting of the incident to credit 
card companies, credit bureaus, and law enforcement 
agencies; and the level of distress identity theft victims 
experienced.

*********************************************
For 85% of identity theft victims, 
the most recent incident involved 
he unauthorized use of an existing account 
*********************************************

In 2012, the unauthorized misuse or attempted misuse of an 
existing account was the most common type of identity theft, 
experienced by 15.3 million persons age 16 or older (6% of 
all persons) (table 1). The majority of victims experienced 
the fraudulent use of their credit cards (7.7 million or 3% 
of all persons) or bank accounts (7.5 million or 3% of all 
persons). Another 1.7 million victims (0.7% of all persons) 
experienced other types of existing account theft, such as 
misuse or attempted misuse of an existing telephone, online, 
or insurance account.

An estimated 1.1 million victims (less than 1% of all 
persons) reported the fraudulent misuse of their information 
to open a new account, such as a credit card. Another 
833,600 victims reported the misuse of their personal 
information for other fraudulent purposes.

During the most recent identity theft incident in 2012, 8% 
of 1.2 million victims experienced multiple types of 
identity theft during a single incident. For 66% of victims 
of multiple types of identity theft, the incident involved 
the unauthorized use of a combination of existing accounts, 
such as credit card, checking, savings, telephone, or online 
accounts. The remaining 34% who experienced multiple types 
of identity theft during a single incident (less than 3% of 
all victims) reported some combination of misuse of an 
existing account, misuse of personal information to open a 
new account, and personal information used for other 
fraudulent purposes. 

*********************************************
Persons in households with higher annual 
incomes were more likely to experience 
identity theft than persons in lower-income 
households 
*********************************************

A similar percentage of males and females (7%) experienced 
identity theft in 2012 (table 2). Across all types of 
identity theft, prevalence rates did not vary significantly 
by sex. After accounting for whether a person owned a credit 
card and bank account, prevalence rates for existing credit 
card and existing banking account misuse did not vary by 
sex. 

Persons ages 16 to 17 (less than 1%) were the least likely 
to experience identity theft, followed by persons ages 18 to 
24 (5%) and 65 or older (5%). After accounting for credit 
card ownership, persons ages 16 to 24 were the least likely 
to experience the misuse of an existing account, while 
persons age 65 or older had a similar prevalence rate as 
persons ages 25 to 34. Among those who had a bank account, 
persons ages 16 to 17 and 65 or older were the least likely 
to experience banking account fraud.

A greater percentage of white non-Hispanics (7%) experienced 
identity theft in 2012 than black non-Hispanics (5%) and 
Hispanics (5%). This relationship also held true for the 
misuse of an existing credit card account among persons who 
had a credit card. However, among persons who had a bank 
account, there were no significant differences in the 
prevalence of bank account misuse among whites, blacks, and 
Hispanics. 

Overall, persons in the highest income category (those with 
an annual household income of $75,000 or more) had a higher 
prevalence of identity theft than persons in other income 
brackets. After accounting for credit card ownership, 
persons in the highest income bracket had the highest rate 
of existing credit card account misuse. Among persons who 
had a bank account, there were no significant differences in 
the prevalence of identity theft across income categories, 
with the exception of the unknown category.

*********************************************
The most common way victims discovered the 
identity theft was from contact by a 
financial institution about a problem 
*********************************************

The way victims discovered that their identifying 
information was misused varied by the type of identity 
theft. Among victims who experienced the unauthorized use of 
an existing account, 45% discovered the identity theft when 
a financial institution contacted them about suspicious 
activity on their account (figure 2). In comparison, 15% of 
victims who experienced the misuse of personal information 
to open a new account or for other fraudulent purposes 
discovered the incident when a financial institution 
contacted them. Victims of these other types of identity 
theft were more likely than victims of existing account 
misuse to discover the incident when another type of company 
or agency contacted them (21%) or after they received an 
unpaid bill (13%). Twenty percent of victims of existing 
account misuse discovered the incident because of fraudulent 
charges on their account, compared to 8% of victims of other 
types of identity theft.
 
*********************************************
The majority of identity theft victims did 
not know how the offender obtained their 
information
*********************************************

About 32% of identity theft victims knew how the offender 
obtained their information (figure 3). Victims who 
experienced multiple types of identity theft during a single 
incident (47%) were among the most likely victims to know 
how the offender obtained the information. Victims who had 
an existing credit card account misused (24%) were among the 
least likely to know how the offender obtained the account 
information. Of the 5.3 million victims who knew how the 
identity theft occurred, the most common way offenders 
obtained information (43%) was to steal it during a purchase 
or other transaction (not shown).

*********************************************
9 in 10 identity theft victims did not know 
anything about the offender
*********************************************

Overall, most identity theft victims (91%) in 2012 did not 
know anything about the identity of the offender (table 3). 
However, the percentage of victims who knew something about 
offender varied depending on the type of identity theft. 
Victims who had personal information used to open a new 
account (25%) or for other fraudulent purposes (23%) were 
more likely than victims of existing account misuse (7%) to 
know something about the offender. Across all types of 
identity theft, victims who experienced the misuse of an 
existing credit card (3%) were the least likely to know 
something about the offender.

*********************************************
Two-thirds of identity theft victims reported 
a direct financial loss 
*********************************************

The economic impact of identity theft is comprised of direct 
and indirect financial loss. Direct financial loss, the 
majority of the total loss associated with identity theft, 
refers to the monetary amount the offender obtained from 
misusing the victim’s account or personal information, 
including the estimated value of goods, services, or cash 
obtained. Indirect loss includes any other costs caused by 
the identity theft, such as legal fees, bounced checks, and 
other miscellaneous expenses (e.g., postage, phone calls, or 
notary fees).

In 2012, 68% of identity theft victims reported a combined 
direct and indirect financial loss associated with the most 
recent incident (appendix table 8). Overall, victims who 
experienced a direct and indirect financial loss of at least 
$1 lost an average of $1,769 with a median loss of $300.
The amount of financial loss varied by the type of identity 
theft. Approximately 69% of credit card fraud, 74% of bank 
fraud, 46% of new account fraud, and 38% of personal 
information fraud victims experienced a financial loss 
during the past 12 months. Of those victims who experienced 
multiple types of identity theft, 69% reported a financial 
loss.

In 2012, 66% of the 16.6 million victims of identity theft 
reported a direct financial loss as a result of the identity 
theft incident. About 68% of credit card fraud victims, 74% 
of bank fraud victims, 42% of new account fraud victims, and 
32% of personal information fraud victims reported that the 
offender obtained money, goods, or services. Of those 
victims who experienced multiple types of identity theft, 
67% reported a direct financial loss associated with the 
incident. 

Of those who reported a direct financial loss, victims who 
experienced the misuse of their personal information 
reported a mean direct loss of $9,650 and a median direct 
loss of $1,900. Victims of new account fraud incurred an 
average loss per incident of $7,135 and a median loss of 
$600. Victims of multiple types of fraud reported an average 
direct loss of $2,140 with a median direct loss of $400, 
while victims of existing account misuse had an average loss 
of $1,003 per incident with a median direct loss of $200. 

In addition to any direct financial loss, 6% of all identity 
theft victims reported indirect losses associated with the 
most recent incident of identity theft. Victims who suffered 
an indirect loss of at least $1 reported an average indirect 
loss of $4,168, with a median of $30. With the exception of 
victims of personal information fraud, identity theft 
victims who reported indirect financial loss had a median 
indirect loss of $100 or less. 

*********************************************
Direct and indirect identity theft losses 
totaled $24.7 billion in 2012
*********************************************

Identity theft victims reported a total of $24.7 billion in 
direct and indirect losses attributed to all incidents of 
identity theft experienced in 2012 (table 4).***Footnote 2 
2For victims who experienced multiple incidents of identity 
theft, the total includes losses from all incidents 
experienced during the past 12 months.*** These losses 
exceeded the $14 billion victims lost from all other 
property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft) 
measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey in 2012. 
Identity theft losses were over 4 times greater than losses 
due to stolen money and property in burglaries ($5.2 
billion) and theft ($5.7 billion), and eight times the total 
losses associated with motor vehicle theft ($3.1 billion).

*********************************************
In 2012, 14% of identity theft victims suffered 
an out-of-pocket financial loss
*********************************************

In some instances, a company (e.g., credit card or insurance 
company) may reimburse some or all of the financial loss, 
reducing or eliminating the out-of-pocket losses for 
victims. At the time of the interview, 14% of victims of 
identity theft had experienced personal out-of-pocket 
financial losses of $1 or more. Of these victims who 
suffered an out-of-pocket financial loss, 49% had total 
losses of $99 or less (figure 4). About 18% of victims 
reported out-of-pocket expenses of $100 to $249. An 
additional 16% of identity theft victims reported that out-
of-pocket expenses of $1,000 or more.

*********************************************
Victims of identity theft who experienced 
existing account misuse were the least likely 
to have credit-related problems
*********************************************
 
In addition to suffering monetary losses, some identity 
theft victims experienced other financial and legal 
problems. They paid higher interest rates on credit cards, 
they were turned down for loans or other credit, their 
utilities were turned off, or they were the subject of 
criminal proceedings. Victims who experienced the misuse of 
an existing account were generally less likely to experience 
financial and legal problems as a result of the incident 
than victims who had other personal information misused. In 
2012, 2% of victims of existing account misuse experienced 
problems with debt collectors, compared to 17% of victims 
who had personal information misused (figure 5). Two percent 
of victims of existing account misuse experienced credit-
related problems (e.g., higher interest rates or repeatedly 
having to correct information on a credit report), compared 
to 12% of victims of other types of identity theft. Less 
than 1% of victims of existing account misuse and 3% of 
victims of other types of identity theft had utilities cut 
off or service denied, legal problems (e.g., being 
arrested), or other problems (e.g., income tax issues).

*********************************************
 Identity theft victims were less likely than 
violent crime victims to have significant 
school, work, or relationship problems as 
a result of the crime
*********************************************

The 2012 NCVS asked victims of violent crime (including rape 
or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple 
assault) about the impact of the victimization on work, 
school, and personal relationships, and the amount of 
emotional distress it caused. Compared to violent crime 
victims surveyed in 2012, a lower percentage of identity 
theft victims reported significant problems at work or 
school or with family members or friends due to the incident 
(figure 6). About 1% of identity theft victims reported 
significant problems at work or school, compared to 12% of 
violent crime victims. Similarly, 4% of identity theft 
victims reported significant problems with family members or 
friends, compared to 19% of violent crime victims.
 
The percentage of identity theft victims who reported 
significant problems at work or school as a result of the 
incident varied by type of identity theft. About 6% of 
victims who had personal information used to open a new 
account reported significant problems at work or school, 
compared to about 1% of victims of existing credit card and 
bank account misuse (appendix table 11). The largest 
percentage of identity theft victims who had significant 
problems with family or friends had their personal 
information used to create new accounts (10%) or for other 
fraudulent purposes (10%).

Identity theft victims (10%) were also less likely than 
violent crime victims (27%) to report that the victimization 
was severely distressing (figure 7). However, the level of 
emotional distress varied by type of identity theft. Thirty-
two percent of victims of personal information fraud 
reported that they found the incident severely distressing, 
compared to 5% of credit card fraud victims. Twenty-two 
percent of victims of new account fraud reported that the 
crime was severely distressing.

*********************************************
The majority of identity theft victims spent 
a day or less resolving associated financial
and credit problems
*********************************************

At the time of the interview, 86% of identity theft victims 
had resolved any problems associated with the incident 
(appendix table 13). Of these, the majority spent a day or 
less clearing up the problems, while about 10% spent more 
than a month (figure 8). Victims of the misuse of existing 
accounts (54%) were more likely to resolve any associated 
financial and credit problems within a day, compared to 
victims of new account fraud (42%) and victims of multiple 
types of identity theft (36%). Among victims who had 
resolved all problems associated with the identity theft, 
29% who experienced the misuse of personal information for 
fraudulent purposes spent over a month clearing up the 
problems, compared to 9% of victims of existing account 
misuse.
 
Whether identity theft victims had resolved associated 
problems or not at the time of the interview, victims 
reported spending an average of about 9 hours clearing up 
the issues. Victims of existing credit card account misuse 
spent an average of 3 hours resolving problems, while 
victims whose personal information was used to open a new 
account or for other fraudulent purposes spent an average of 
about 30 hours resolving all problems (not shown).

*********************************************
14% of persons experienced identity theft at 
some point during their lives
*********************************************

Resolving the problems caused by identity theft may take 
more than a year for some victims. Of the 20.3 million 
persons age 16 or older who experienced the misuse of 
existing accounts or other personal information prior to 
2012, 7% were still resolving the problems associated with 
the identity theft more than a year later (table 5). A 
greater percentage of persons who experienced the misuse of 
personal information to open a new account (16%) or for 
other fraudulent purposes (15%) prior to 2012 had unresolved 
problems more than a year later, compared to persons who 
experienced existing account misuse (4%).

Overall, 14% of persons age 16 or older, or 34.2 million 
persons, experienced one or more incidents of identity theft 
during their lives. The lifetime prevalence rate for 
identity theft varied to some degree with age. Younger 
persons, ages 16 to 17 (1%) and 18 to 24 (7%) and persons 
ages 65 or older (11%) had the lowest lifetime prevalence 
rates, while between 15% and 17% of persons ages 25 to 64 
experienced identity theft at some point in their lives (not 
shown in table).

*********************************************
The level of emotional distress victims 
experienced was related to the length of 
time they spent resolving problems
*********************************************

Victims who spent more time resolving the financial and 
credit-related problems associated with the identity theft 
incident were more likely to experience problems with work 
and other relationships and severe emotional distress than 
victims who were able to resolve the problems relatively 
quickly. Among identity theft victims who spent 6 months or 
more resolving financial and credit problems due to the 
theft, 47% experienced severe emotional distress (figure 9). 
In comparison, 4% of victims who spent a day or less 
clearing up problems reported that the incident was severely 
distressing. Similarly, 14% of victims who spent 6 months or 
more resolving issues related to the identity theft reported 
having significant problems with family members or friends, 
compared to about 2% of victims who spent a day or less 
resolving problems. 

*********************************************
Fewer than 1 in 10 identity theft victims 
reported the incident to police
*********************************************

In 2012, about 9% of identity theft victims reported the 
incident to police (figure 10). Victims of personal 
information fraud were the most likely to report the 
incident to police (40%), followed new account fraud victims 
(23%) and victims of multiple types of identity theft (22%). 
Fewer than 10% of victims of existing credit card (4%), 
existing bank account (9%), and other existing account 
misuse (6%) reported the incident to police. 

The 91% of identity theft victims who did not report an 
incident to police offered a variety of reasons for not 
reporting (appendix table 17). Among all victims who did not 
report the incident to police, the most common reason was 
that the victim handled it another way (58%). About a third 
(29%) of nonreporting victims did not contact police because 
they suffered no monetary loss. One in five nonreporting 
victims did not think that the police could help and another 
15% did not know how to report the incident to law 
enforcement.

*********************************************
Of the 9% of identity theft victims who 
contacted a credit bureau, 7 in 10 placed 
a fraud alert on their credit report
*********************************************

In 2012, 88% of all victims of identity theft reported the 
incident to one or more nonlaw enforcement agencies, either 
government or commercial (not shown). About 86% of identity 
theft victims contacted a credit card company or bank to 
report misuse or attempted misuse of an account or personal 
information (appendix table 19). Six percent of all identity 
theft victims contacted a credit monitoring service, 3% 
contacted an agency that issues identity documentation, 
(e.g., Social Security Administration or an agency that 
issues drivers’ licenses), 1% contacted the Federal Trade 
Commission, and 1% contacted a government consumer affairs 
agency or other consumer protection organization, (e.g., 
Better Business Bureau).

Nine percent of identity theft victims contacted a credit 
bureau to report the incident. Victims whose identifying 
information was fraudulently used to open a new account 
(30%) were most likely to contact a credit bureau, followed 
by victims of multiple types of theft (20%) and victims 
whose personal information was used for other fraudulent 
purposes (19%).

Victims of any type of identity theft who contacted a credit 
bureau could take several different actions. About 70% of 
victims who contacted a credit bureau placed a fraud alert 
on their credit report (figure 11). Two-thirds (66%) of 
victims who contacted a credit bureau requested a credit 
report, 41% requested corrections to their credit report, 
38% placed a freeze on their credit report, and 19% provided 
a police report to the credit bureau. 

*********************************************
About 85% of persons took some action to 
prevent identity theft victimization
*********************************************

The ITS asked persons about actions they took during the 
prior 12 months to prevent identity theft, such as checking 
credit reports, shredding documents with personal 
information, and changing passwords on financial accounts. 
In 2012, 85% of persons engaged in one or more of the 
preventative actions asked about in the survey (table 6). A 
greater percentage of victims (96%) than nonvictims (84%) 
engaged in at least one preventative action. However, about 
12% of victims who took preventative action did so in 
response to experiencing identity theft in the past year. 

Overall, the two most common preventative actions in 2012 
were checking bank or credit statements (75%) and shredding 
or destroying documents with personal information (67%). A 
higher percentage of victims than nonvictims engaged in both 
of these preventative actions. However, about 13% of victims 
began shredding or destroying documents with personal 
information as a result of experiencing identity theft 
during the prior 12 months and 26% began checking bank or 
credit statements as a result of the victimization. 

Less than 10% of victims purchased identity theft protection 
(4%) or insurance (6%) or used an identity theft security 
program on the computer (6%) after experiencing identity 
theft, while about a quarter of victims checked financial 
accounts or changed passwords on these accounts as a result 
of the victimization.

Among persons who did not experience identity theft in 2012, 
37% checked their credit report; 27% changed passwords on 
financial accounts; 16% used identity theft security 
programs on their computer; 5% purchased identity theft 
insurance or used a credit monitoring service; and 3% 
purchased identity theft protection.

Methodology
**************

Data collection
*****************

The Identity Theft Supplement (ITS) was administered as a 
supplement to the Bureau of Justice Statistic’s (BJS) 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS 
collects data on crime reported and not reported to the 
police against persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. households. The sample 
includes persons living in group quarters (such as 
dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings) 
and excludes persons living in military barracks and 
institutional settings (such as correctional or hospital 
facilities) and the homeless. (For more information, see the 
Survey Methodology in Criminal Victimization in the United 
States, 2008, NCJ 231173, BJS website, May 2011.) 

From January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2012, persons age 16 
or older in sampled NCVS households received the ITS at the 
end of the NCVS interview. Proxy responders and those who 
complete the NCVS interview in a language other than English 
did not receive the ITS. All NCVS and ITS interviews were 
conducted in a computer-assisted personal interviewing 
(CAPI) environment. Interviews were conducted by telephone 
or by personal visit. A final sample size of 69,814 of the 
original NCVS-eligible respondents completed the ITS 
questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 91.9%.
 
The combined overall NCVS-ITS unit response rate for NCVS 
households, NCVS persons, and ITS persons was 68.2%. Because 
of the level of nonresponse, a bias analysis was conducted. 
To the extent that those who responded to the survey and 
those who did not differ in important ways, there is 
potential for bias in estimates from the survey data. 
However, the result of the nonresponse bias analysis 
suggested that there was little or no bias of substantive 
importance due to nonresponse in the ITS estimates.

The ITS collected individual data on the prevalence of and 
victim response to the attempted or successful misuse of an 
existing account, misuse of personal information to open a 
new account, or misuse of personal information for other 
fraudulent purposes. Respondents were asked whether they 
experienced any of these types of misuse during the 12 
months prior to the interview. For example, persons 
interviewed in July 2012 were asked about identity theft 
incidents that occurred between July 2011 and June 2012. To 
simplify the discussion of the findings, this report refers 
to all identity theft experienced during the 12 months prior 
to the interviews as occurring in 2012.

Persons who reported one or more incidents of identity theft 
during 2012 were asked more detailed questions about the 
incident and response to the incident, such as how they 
discovered the identity theft; financial, credit, and other 
problems resulting from the incident; time spent resolving 
associated problems; and reporting to police and credit 
bureaus. For most sections of the survey instrument, the ITS 
asked victims who experienced more than one incident during 
the 12-month reference period to describe only the most 
recent incident when answering questions. The ITS asked 
victims who experienced multiple incidents of identity theft 
during the year to report on the total financial losses 
suffered as a result of all incidents. The ITS asked both 
victims and nonvictims a series of questions about identity 
theft they experienced outside of the 12-month reference 
period and about measures they took to avoid or minimize the 
risk of becoming an identity theft victim.

Comparison of 2012 findings to prior BJS 
identity theft statistics
*********************************************

This report uses data that differ from previous BJS 
statistical collections on the topic of identity theft. Due 
to the differences, it was not possible to compare the 
identity theft estimates presented in this report to 
previously reported estimates.
 
Initial BJS reports on identity theft used household-level 
data from the core NCVS. Data were reported for the 
household as a whole rather than for individual respondents, 
and the questions were more limited, providing less detail 
on the characteristics of the incident and the victim 
response. For additional information, see Identity Theft, 
2005, NCJ 219411, BJS website, November 2007, Identity Theft 
Reported by Households, 2007 - Statistical Tables, NCJ 
230742, BJS website, June 2010, and Identity Theft Reported

In 2008, BJS conducted the first Identity Theft Supplement 
to the NCVS. Like the 2012 ITS, the 2008 ITS collected 
detailed information on victim experiences with identity 
theft from persons age 16 or older. For more information, 
see Victims of Identity Theft, 2008, NCJ 231680, BJS 
website, December 2010. Following the administration of the 
first ITS, BJS made substantial changes to the survey 
instrument, making it difficult to compare across the 2008 
and 2012 datasets. Some of the major changes to the survey 
from 2008 to 2012 included—

* Changing from a 2-year to 1-year reference period. The 
2008 ITS asked about identity theft experienced in the 2 
years prior to the interview. The 2-year reference period 
was intended to capture incidents of identity theft that 
were discovered more than 12 months prior to the interview 
but were still causing problems for the victim. The 2012 ITS 
used a 12-month reference period to be more consistent with 
the NCVS and other NCVS supplements. The 2012 ITS added a 
special section about identity theft experienced outside of 
the 1-year reference period to capture identity theft 
incidents with long-term consequences. 

* Integrating of successful and attempted identity theft 
incidents. The 2008 ITS tried to distinguish attempted 
identity theft from successfully completed identity theft. 
It asked slightly different questions depending on whether 
respondents screened into the attempted or successful 
module. However, the distinction between an attempted and 
successful incident of identity theft was not clear, and the 
two types were combined for reporting purposes to the extent 
possible. The 2012 ITS defined identity theft as attempted 
or completed misuse of personal information and collected 
the same information from all victims. 

* Focusing on the most recent incident of identity theft for 
detailed follow-up questions. In the 2008 ITS, victims were 
asked one set of questions about the characteristics of 
identity theft and the response to identity theft, 
regardless of the number of incidents they experienced 
during the 2-year reference period. This made it impossible 
to attribute the incident characteristics or monetary loss 
to one specific type of identity theft. The 2012 ITS asked 
victims to identify whether they experienced one or more 
than one incidents of identity theft during the year.
***Footnote 3 Victims received the following definition of 
an identity theft incident: “An incident of identity theft 
occurs when your identity is stolen. A stolen credit card 
or debit card may be used multiple times, but this should 
be considered a single incident."*** Victims who experienced 
more than one incident were asked to describe only the most 
recent incident when responding to detailed questions about 
the nature of and experiences with identity theft victimization. 

Possible over-reporting of losses from 
jointly held accounts
*********************************************

Persons may have experienced the unauthorized use of a 
jointly held account. Joint accounts present a difficulty 
with counting financial harm or loss because of the 
potential for double-counting loss (e.g., both account 
holders report the same $500 loss). Because financial loss 
was not attributed to a particular type of identity theft, 
victims of multiple types of identity theft may have 
experienced some financial loss from a joint account and 
some financial loss from an independently held account. 
Therefore, it was not possible to correct for any potential 
over-reporting due to joint account holders who may have 
been double counted.

Standard error computations
*****************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the 
case with the ITS, caution must be taken when comparing one 
estimate to another. Although one estimate may be larger 
than another, estimates based on a sample have some degree 
of sampling error. The sampling error of an estimate depends 
on several factors, including the amount of variation in the 
responses, the size of the sample, and the size of the 
subgroup for which the estimate is computed. When the 
sampling error around the estimates is taken into 
consideration, the estimates that appear different may, not 
be statistically different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an 
estimate is the standard error. The standard error can vary 
from one estimate to the next. In general, for a given 
metric, an estimate with a smaller standard error provides a 
more reliable approximation of the true value than an 
estimate with a larger standard error. Estimates with 
relatively large standard errors are associated with less 
precision and reliability and should be interpreted with 
caution.

In order to generate standard errors around estimates from 
the ITS, the Census Bureau produces generalized variance 
function (GVF) parameters for BJS. The GVFs take into 
account aspects of the NCVS complex sample design and 
represent the curve fitted to a selection of individual 
standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication 
technique. The GVF parameters were used to generate standard 
errors for each point estimate (i.e., numbers or 
percentages) in the report. 

In this report, BJS conducted tests to determine whether 
differences in estimated numbers and percentages were 
statistically significant once sampling error was taken into 
account. Using statistical programs developed specifically 
for the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were tested for 
significance. The primary test procedure used was Student’s 
t-statistic, which tests the difference between two sample 
estimates. To ensure that the observed differences between 
estimates were larger than might be expected due to sampling 
variation, the significance level was set at the 95% 
confidence level.
 
Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of 
the estimates provided in this report to generate a 
confidence interval around the estimate as a measure of the 
margin of error. The following example illustrates how 
standard errors can be used to generate confidence 
intervals: 

* According to the ITS, in 2012, an estimated 6.7% of 
persons age 16 or older experienced identity theft (see 
table 1). Using the GVFs, BJS determined that the estimate 
has a standard error of 0.3 (see appendix table 1). A 
confidence interval around the estimate was generated by 
multiplying the standard errors by ±1.96 (the t-score of a 
normal, two-tailed distribution that excludes 2.5% at either 
end of the distribution). Therefore, the confidence interval 
around the estimate is 6.7 ± (0.3 X 1.96) or 6.1 to 7.3. In 
other words, if different samples using the same procedures 
were taken from the U.S. population in 2012, 95% of the time 
the percentage of persons who experienced identity theft 
would be between 6.1% and 7.3%.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of 
variation (CV) for all estimates, representing the ratio of 
the standard error to the estimate. CVs provide a measure of 
reliability and a means to compare the precision of 
estimates across measures with differing levels or metrics. 
In cases where the CV was greater than 50%, or the 
unweighted sample had 10 or fewer cases, the estimate was 
noted with a “!” symbol (interpret data with caution; 
estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the 
coefficient of variation exceeds 50%). 

Many of the variables examined in this report may be related 
to one another and to other variables not included in the 
analyses. Complex relationships among variables were not 
fully explored in this report and warrant more extensive 
analysis. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal 
inferences based on the results presented.
