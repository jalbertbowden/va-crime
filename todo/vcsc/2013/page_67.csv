,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
It has also been suggested that some offenders currently being supervised for a,
"violent offense may respond well to the structure provided by the program, but they",
are statutorily excluded at this time.,Research from the HOPE program in Hawaii
and a similar program in Washington indicates that offenders who are currently on,
supervision in the community for a violent offense may respond equally well to the,
close scrutiny and the swiftness and certainty of sanctions imposed in this type of,
program. Expanding Virginia's pilot program to include offenders currently on,
probation for a violent offense would require legislative action.,
Stakeholders in Lynchburg developed an innovative approach to expand the pool,
of eligible offenders.,The Probation & Parole District there covers several
"jurisdictions (the City of Lynchburg as well as Amherst, Campbell, and Nelson",
Counties).,Participants in the Lynchburg pilot program must have an obligation to
"Lynchburg Circuit Court. However, probation staff identified offenders believed to",
be good candidates for the program who lived just outside the Lynchburg City line.,
"At the suggestion of Lynchburg stakeholders, the Sentencing Commission approached",
"the Sheriffs in the neighboring Amherst and Campbell Counties, who agreed to assist",
with the pilot program by quickly executing Lynchburg's PB-15 arrest warrants in their,
"respective jurisdictions. As a result, the pool of potential program participants for",
Lynchburg's pilot has been expanded to include those living outside the Lynchburg,
City limits.,This is an excellent example of stakeholders innovating and collaborating
to improve the implementation of the program in their jurisdiction.,
Stakeholders have also provided feedback on the requirements for removing,
"offenders from the program and, as a result, the Sentencing Commission approved a",
modification.,Based on the Sentencing Commission's initial program design
"(approved September 2012), a participant convicted of any new offense would be",
removed from the program. After a participant who had been otherwise compliant,
"was cited for driving on a suspended license, some of the stakeholders from Henrico",
attended the Sentencing Commission's June 10 meeting to request that judges be,
given some discretion regarding removal of participants who have been convicted of,
a new offense. The concern was that an offender participating in the program might,
"be convicted of a minor misdemeanor offense, such as driving on a suspended",
license or being drunk in public.,"In most cases, however, an offender convicted of"
driving on a suspended license or certain other misdemeanor offenses is unlikely to,
serve significant jail time.,If the offender were removed from the Immediate
"Sanction Probation program, he or she would likely return to regular probation,",
where supervision would be less intensive than when the offender was participating,
in the program.,"Under these circumstances, continuing the offender in the Immediate"
Sanction Probation program following release from jail could better serve public,
safety.,The Sentencing Commission approved a change to provide judges with
discretion as to whether or not to remove offenders convicted of a new,
misdemeanor.,The Sentencing Commission continues to require that offenders
convicted of a new felony be removed from the program.,
