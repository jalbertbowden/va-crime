,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
The judge may give the probationer the official warning immediately after ordering,
the probationer to complete the program or the judge may schedule a formal,
warning hearing with other probationers placed into the program. It is important that,
judges use the same language and communicate a consistent message to each,
probationer who is placed in the Immediate Sanction Probation program.,For this
"reason, the Sentencing Commission has developed a standardized script for the",
judges' use.,"The script, which is based on the one used in Hawaii's HOPE program, is"
shown in Figure 35.,

Warning Script,
,Immediate Sanction
,Probation Program Warning Script
You have been placed in a program called Immediate Sanction Probation. You have been put in this,
program because you have not been doing your part and following the rules of probation. When you,
"are on probation instead of serving time in prison, you are making a deal with the judge to follow the",
rules. You are the one responsible for making sure that you comply with the rules of probation. If you,
"choose not to follow the rules of probation, from this point on, there will be immediate consequences.",
"From now on, if you fail a drug test, if you fail to meet with your probation officer when you are",
"supposed to, or if you don't comply with any other term of your probation, such as attending treatment",
"if you have been told to go, you will be arrested and you will go to jail. This will happen for each",
and every violation.,
You will be frequently drug tested.,Your probation officer will advise you when to come in for
"testing. If you test positive, you will be arrested on the spot, held in custody, and we will have a",
"hearing a couple of days later. If you use drugs, you will go to jail. If you miss a drug test or a",
"scheduled appointment or don't comply with any other condition of probation, a police officer or",
"Sheriff's deputy will find you and arrest you. They will arrest you at work or home or wherever, and",
"you will go to jail. If you continue to violate the conditions of supervision, I can remove you from the",
"program and revoke your probation. If that happens, I may give you a prison sentence.",
"I understand that things happen in life. If your car breaks down on the way to the probation office,",
"push it to the side of the road, call your probation officer, tell him or her that you will be late, and get",
"on the bus. If you or your child is at the Emergency Room, call your probation officer to reschedule",
your appointment and be ready to bring proof of the medical treatment when you come for that,
appointment.,
"All of your actions in life have consequences, good or bad. If you confront your problems and learn",
"to change your thinking and your behavior, you will be able to follow the rules of probation and be",
"able to remain free in society. The more responsible you are, the more freedom you will have. The",
"less responsible you are, the less freedom you will have. If you violate the rules, there will be",
"consequences, and they will happen right away. It's all about your choices.",
Do you understand everything I just said? Do you have any questions for me?,
I wish you success on probation after today and hope I don't see you back in a courtroom anytime,
soon.,
