,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Design of Virginia's,
Immediate Sanction Probation Program,
The Sentencing Commission has designed Virginia's Immediate Sanction Probation,
program based on the parameters established by the General Assembly's statutory,
and budgetary language and the key elements of the swift-and-certain sanctions,
model pioneered in Hawaii.,Implementing Virginia's program with fidelity to the
basic tenets of the swift-and-certain sanctions model provides the best opportunity to,
determine if the positive results observed in other states will emerge in Virginia as,
well.,
"To be considered for the Immediate Sanction Probation program, offenders must",
"meet certain criteria. In § 19.2-303.5, the General Assembly specifies that the",
offender must:,
Not be on probation for a violent offense defined in § 17.1-805.,
The Sentencing Commission set additional criteria for the pilot program.,To be
"eligible, an offender must:",
Be 18 years of age or older (there are presently a wide array of sanction,
"options available for juveniles tried as adults in circuit court),",
Be on supervised probation for a felony conviction (not given a deferred,
"disposition, as that does not include a suspended term of incarceration),",
Have a recent risk/needs assessment on file (based on the COMPAS instrument,
"currently utilized by the Department of Corrections for supervision planning),",
Not have been diagnosed with a severe mental health issue (these offenders,
may not be able to fully comprehend the consequences for violations and be,
"able to modify their behavior), and",
Be supervised in the same jurisdiction where the offender was originally,
sentenced.,
"Since the program is being implemented in only four pilot sites, this last eligibility",
criteria ensures that judges in the pilot sites have jurisdiction over the cases and can,
swiftly impose sanctions.,
