,Introduction
Projecting the Impact of Proposed Legislation,
Section 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia requires the Commission to prepare fiscal,
impact statements for any proposed legislation that may result in a net increase in,
periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities. These impact statements must,
"include details as to the impact on adult, as well as juvenile, offender populations",
and any necessary adjustments to sentencing guideline recommendations. Any impact,
statement required under § 30-19.1:4 also must include an analysis of the impact on,
"local and regional jails, as well as state and local community corrections programs.",
"During the 2013 General Assembly, the Commission prepared 342 impact statements",
on proposed legislation. The Commission prepared more impact statements for the,
"2013 Session of the General Assembly than in any year since 2000, when the",
Commission began tracking legislative trends. These proposals included: 1),
legislation to increase the felony penalty class of a specific crime; 2) legislation to,
increase the penalty class of a specific crime from a misdemeanor to a felony; 3),
legislation to add a new mandatory minimum penalty for a specific crime; 4),
legislation to expand or clarify an existing crime; and 5) legislation that would,
create a new criminal offense.,The Commission utilizes its computer simulation
forecasting program to estimate the projected impact of these proposals on the prison,
system. The estimated impact on the juvenile offender population is provided by,
"Virginia's Department of Juvenile Justice. In most instances, the projected impact and",
accompanying analysis of a bill is presented to the General Assembly within 24 to,
48 hours after the Commission is notified of the proposed legislation. When,
"requested, the Commission provides pertinent oral testimony to accompany the",
impact analysis. Additional impact analyses may be conducted at the request of,
"House Appropriations Committee staff, Senate Finance Committee staff, the Secretary",
"of Public Safety, or staff of the Department of Planning and Budget.",
