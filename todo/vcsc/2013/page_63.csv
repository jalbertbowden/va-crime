,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Defense Counsel,
"In Lynchburg and Arlington, defense counsel is provided by the Public Defender's",
Office.,"Since Henrico does not have a Public Defender's Office, defense counsel is"
provided by six court-appointed attorneys who have agreed to work with the,
Immediate Sanction Program.,Harrisonburg/Rockingham will also use court-
appointed attorneys. For hearings associated with the Immediate Sanction Probation,
"program, the court-appointed attorneys are paid at the same hourly rate as they are",
paid for traditional probation violation hearings ($90 per hour). This program may,
"result in additional hearings for some offenders, as they test the boundaries of the",
program and are brought back to court for each violation.,"During the pilot project,"
the Virginia Supreme Court is absorbing the cost of court-appointed attorneys for the,
"Immediate Sanction Probation program. As of September 27, 2013, the",
"expenditures for this purpose have totaled $4,320 ($1,492 in FY2013 and $2,828 in",
FY2014).,
Court Processes,
The pilot sites have established an expedited court process for dealing with program,
candidates and violations.,Immediate Sanction Probation hearings are held on
multiple days of the week so that offenders will not spend long in jail before being,
considered for placement in the program or having a violation heard by the court.,
Hearings for violations occur swiftly (usually within three business days following,
arrest). This expedited process diverges significantly from the normal probation,
"violation process in Virginia, which can take weeks or even months in some",
jurisdictions.,
"In Henrico and Lynchburg (the two programs operational at the time of this report),",
"judges usually conduct Immediate Sanction Probation hearings on Monday,",
"Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 to 1:30 p.m.",This time slot is designated for both
"candidate review hearings, where the judge considers whether or not to place the",
"offender in the program, and program violations. If there are no candidates or",
"violations to be heard on a given day, stakeholders simply use the time for normal",
work-related activities.,Based on a sample of hearings conducted in Henrico and
"Lynchburg, the candidate review hearings last, on average, 9.5 minutes each, while",
violations have been handled in an average of 7.0 minutes.,This is comparable to
the length of hearings in Hawaii's HOPE program.,
