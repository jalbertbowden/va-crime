The Commission provides sentencing guidelines assistance in a variety of forms:,
"training and education seminars, training materials and publications, a website, and",
"assistance via the ""hotline"" phone system. Training and education are ongoing",
activities of the Commission. The Commission offers training and educational,
opportunities in an effort to promote the accurate completion of sentencing,
guidelines. Training seminars are designed to appeal to the needs of attorneys for,
"the Commonwealth and probation officers, the two groups authorized by statute to",
complete the official guidelines for the court. The seminars also provide defense,
attorneys with a knowledge base to challenge the accuracy of guidelines submitted,
"to the court. In addition, the Commission conducts sentencing guidelines seminars for",
new members of the judiciary and other criminal justice system professionals.,Having
all sides equally versed in the completion of guidelines worksheets is essential to a,
system of checks and balances that ensures the accuracy of sentencing guidelines.,
"In FY2013, the Commission offered 80 training seminars across the Commonwealth",
"for more than 1,070 criminal justice professionals. As in previous years, Commission",
staff conducted training for attorneys and probation officers new to Virginia's,
sentencing guidelines system. The six-hour seminar introduced participants to the,
sentencing guidelines and provided instruction on correct scoring of the guidelines,
worksheets. The seminar also introduced new users to the probation violation,
guidelines and the two risk assessment instruments that are incorporated into Virginia's,
guidelines system.,A two-hour What's New seminar was offered for all criminal
justice professionals prior to the rollout of the FY2013 guidelines revisions. This,
seminar informed users of the significant changes to the nonviolent offender risk,
assessment instrument as well as other changes to the guidelines worksheets.,
Seminars for experienced guidelines users were also provided.,These courses were
"approved by the Virginia State Bar, enabling participating attorneys to earn",
Continuing Legal Education credits. The Commission continued to provide a,
"guidelines-related ethics class for attorneys, which was conducted in conjunction with",
the Virginia State Bar.,The Virginia State Bar approved this class for one hour of
Continuing Legal Education Ethics credit. The Commission also prepared and,
conducted a refresher course to address regional issues identified by staff. This,
"seminar, approved for three Continuing Legal Education credits, reinforced the rules",
for scoring guidelines accurately. A one-hour course was developed and conducted,
for judges based on frequently asked questions.,"Finally, the Commission conducted"
"sentencing guidelines seminars at the Department of Corrections' Training Academy,",
as part of the curriculum for new probation officers.,
