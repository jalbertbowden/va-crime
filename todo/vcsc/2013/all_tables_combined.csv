"Training, Education and Other Assistance",
The Commission provides sentencing guidelines assistance in a variety of forms:,
"training and education seminars, training materials and publications, a website, and",
"assistance via the ""hotline"" phone system. Training and education are ongoing",
activities of the Commission. The Commission offers training and educational,
opportunities in an effort to promote the accurate completion of sentencing,
guidelines. Training seminars are designed to appeal to the needs of attorneys for,
"the Commonwealth and probation officers, the two groups authorized by statute to",
complete the official guidelines for the court. The seminars also provide defense,
attorneys with a knowledge base to challenge the accuracy of guidelines submitted,
"to the court. In addition, the Commission conducts sentencing guidelines seminars for",
new members of the judiciary and other criminal justice system professionals.,Having
all sides equally versed in the completion of guidelines worksheets is essential to a,
system of checks and balances that ensures the accuracy of sentencing guidelines.,
"In FY2013, the Commission offered 80 training seminars across the Commonwealth",
"for more than 1,070 criminal justice professionals. As in previous years, Commission",
staff conducted training for attorneys and probation officers new to Virginia's,
sentencing guidelines system. The six-hour seminar introduced participants to the,
sentencing guidelines and provided instruction on correct scoring of the guidelines,
worksheets. The seminar also introduced new users to the probation violation,
guidelines and the two risk assessment instruments that are incorporated into Virginia's,
guidelines system.,A two-hour What's New seminar was offered for all criminal
justice professionals prior to the rollout of the FY2013 guidelines revisions. This,
seminar informed users of the significant changes to the nonviolent offender risk,
assessment instrument as well as other changes to the guidelines worksheets.,
Seminars for experienced guidelines users were also provided.,These courses were
"approved by the Virginia State Bar, enabling participating attorneys to earn",
Continuing Legal Education credits. The Commission continued to provide a,
"guidelines-related ethics class for attorneys, which was conducted in conjunction with",
the Virginia State Bar.,The Virginia State Bar approved this class for one hour of
Continuing Legal Education Ethics credit. The Commission also prepared and,
conducted a refresher course to address regional issues identified by staff. This,
"seminar, approved for three Continuing Legal Education credits, reinforced the rules",
for scoring guidelines accurately. A one-hour course was developed and conducted,
for judges based on frequently asked questions.,"Finally, the Commission conducted"
"sentencing guidelines seminars at the Department of Corrections' Training Academy,",
as part of the curriculum for new probation officers.,

Projecting the Impact of Proposed Legislation,
Section 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia requires the Commission to prepare fiscal,
impact statements for any proposed legislation that may result in a net increase in,
periods of imprisonment in state correctional facilities. These impact statements must,
"include details as to the impact on adult, as well as juvenile, offender populations",
and any necessary adjustments to sentencing guideline recommendations. Any impact,
statement required under § 30-19.1:4 also must include an analysis of the impact on,
"local and regional jails, as well as state and local community corrections programs.",
"During the 2013 General Assembly, the Commission prepared 342 impact statements",
on proposed legislation. The Commission prepared more impact statements for the,
"2013 Session of the General Assembly than in any year since 2000, when the",
Commission began tracking legislative trends. These proposals included: 1),
legislation to increase the felony penalty class of a specific crime; 2) legislation to,
increase the penalty class of a specific crime from a misdemeanor to a felony; 3),
legislation to add a new mandatory minimum penalty for a specific crime; 4),
legislation to expand or clarify an existing crime; and 5) legislation that would,
create a new criminal offense.,The Commission utilizes its computer simulation
forecasting program to estimate the projected impact of these proposals on the prison,
system. The estimated impact on the juvenile offender population is provided by,
"Virginia's Department of Juvenile Justice. In most instances, the projected impact and",
accompanying analysis of a bill is presented to the General Assembly within 24 to,
48 hours after the Commission is notified of the proposed legislation. When,
"requested, the Commission provides pertinent oral testimony to accompany the",
impact analysis. Additional impact analyses may be conducted at the request of,
"House Appropriations Committee staff, Senate Finance Committee staff, the Secretary",
"of Public Safety, or staff of the Department of Planning and Budget.",

,Guidelines Compliance
"by the guidelines. When risk assessment for nonviolent offenders is applicable, a",
judge may sentence a recommended offender to an alternative punishment program,
or to a term of incarceration within the traditional guidelines range and be,
considered in strict compliance.,A judicial sentence also would be considered in
general agreement with the guidelines recommendation if the sentence 1) meets,
"modest criteria for rounding, 2) involves time already served (in certain instances), or",
3) complies with statutorily-permitted diversion options in habitual offender traffic,
cases.,
Compliance by rounding provides for a modest rounding allowance in instances when,
the active sentence handed down by a judge or jury is very close to the range,
recommended by the guidelines.,"For example, a judge would be considered in"
compliance with the guidelines if he or she sentenced an offender to a two-year,
sentence based on a guidelines recommendation that goes up to 1 year 11 months.,
"In general, the Commission allows for rounding of a sentence that is within 5% of the",
guidelines recommendation.,
Time served compliance is intended to accommodate judicial discretion and the,
complexity of the criminal justice system at the local level.,A judge may sentence an
offender to the amount of pre-sentence incarceration time served in a local jail when,
the guidelines call for a short jail term.,Even though the judge does not sentence an
"offender to post-sentence incarceration time, the Commission typically considers this",
type of case to be in compliance.,"Conversely, a judge who sentences an offender to"
time served when the guidelines call for probation also is regarded as being in,
"compliance with the guidelines, because the offender was not ordered to serve any",
incarceration time after sentencing.,
Compliance through the use of diversion options in habitual offender traffic cases,
"resulted from amendments to § 46.2-357(B2 and B3) of the Code of Virginia,",
"effective July 1, 1997.",The amendment allows judges to suspend the mandatory
minimum 12-month incarceration term required in felony habitual offender traffic,
cases if they sentence the offender to a Detention Center or Diversion Center,
Incarceration Program.,For cases sentenced since the effective date of the
"legislation, the Commission considers either mode of sanctioning of these offenders to",
be in compliance with the sentencing guidelines.,

,Guidelines Compliance
Judges have also typically agreed with guidelines recommendations for other types,
"of dispositions. In FY2013, 77% of offenders received a sentence resulting in",
confinement of six months or less when such a penalty was recommended.,In some
"cases, judges felt probation to be a more appropriate sanction than the",
"recommended jail term and, in other cases, offenders recommended for short-term",
incarceration received a sentence of more than six months.,"Finally, 71% of"
offenders whose guidelines recommendation called for no incarceration were given,
probation and no post-dispositional confinement.,"Some offenders with a ""no"
"incarceration"" recommendation received a short jail term, but rarely did these",
offenders receive an incarceration term of more than six months.,
"Since July 1, 1997, sentences to the state's former Boot Camp and the current",
Detention Center and Diversion Center programs have been defined as incarceration,
sanctions for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines. Although the state's Boot,
"Camp program was discontinued in 2002, the Detention and Diversion Center",
programs have continued as sentencing options for judges.,The Commission
recognized that these programs are more restrictive than probation supervision in the,
"community. In 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court concluded that participation in the",
Detention Center program is a form of incarceration (Charles v. Commonwealth).,
"Because the Diversion Center program also involves a period of confinement, the",
Commission defines both the Detention Center and the Diversion Center programs as,
incarceration terms under the sentencing guidelines.,"Since 1997, the Detention and"
Diversion Center programs have been counted as six months of confinement.,
"However, effective July 1, 2007, the Department of Corrections extended these",
programs by an additional four weeks.,"Therefore, beginning in FY2008, a sentence"
to either the Detention or Diversion Center program counted as seven months of,
confinement for sentencing guideline purposes.,
"Finally, youthful offenders sentenced under the provisions of § 19.2-311, and given",
"an indeterminate commitment to the Department of Corrections, are considered as",
having a four-year incarceration term for the purposes of sentencing guidelines.,
"Under § 19.2-311, a first-time offender who was less than 21 years of age at the",
time of the offense may be given an indeterminate commitment to the Department of,
Corrections with a maximum length-of-stay of four years. Offenders convicted of,
"capital murder, first-degree or second-degree murder, forcible rape (§ 18.2-61),",
"forcible sodomy (§ 18.2-67.1), object sexual penetration (§ 18.2-67.2) or",
"aggravated sexual battery of a victim less than age 13 (§ 18.2-67.3(A,1)) are not",
"eligible for the program. For sentencing guidelines purposes, offenders sentenced",
solely as youthful offenders under § 19.2-311 are considered as having a four-year,
sentence.,

"options available for juveniles tried as adults in circuit court),",
Be on supervised probation for a felony conviction (not given a deferred,
"disposition, as that does not include a suspended term of incarceration),",
Have a recent risk/needs assessment on file (based on the COMPAS instrument,
"currently utilized by the Department of Corrections for supervision planning),",
Not have been diagnosed with a severe mental health issue (these offenders,
may not be able to fully comprehend the consequences for violations and be,
"able to modify their behavior), and",
Be supervised in the same jurisdiction where the offender was originally,
sentenced.,
"Since the program is being implemented in only four pilot sites, this last eligibility",
criteria ensures that judges in the pilot sites have jurisdiction over the cases and can,
swiftly impose sanctions.,

,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
The judge may give the probationer the official warning immediately after ordering,
the probationer to complete the program or the judge may schedule a formal,
warning hearing with other probationers placed into the program. It is important that,
judges use the same language and communicate a consistent message to each,
probationer who is placed in the Immediate Sanction Probation program.,For this
"reason, the Sentencing Commission has developed a standardized script for the",
judges' use.,"The script, which is based on the one used in Hawaii's HOPE program, is"
shown in Figure 35.,
Immediate Sanction Probation,Figure 35
Warning Script,
,Immediate Sanction
,Probation Program Warning Script
You have been placed in a program called Immediate Sanction Probation. You have been put in this,
program because you have not been doing your part and following the rules of probation. When you,
"are on probation instead of serving time in prison, you are making a deal with the judge to follow the",
rules. You are the one responsible for making sure that you comply with the rules of probation. If you,
"choose not to follow the rules of probation, from this point on, there will be immediate consequences.",
"From now on, if you fail a drug test, if you fail to meet with your probation officer when you are",
"supposed to, or if you don't comply with any other term of your probation, such as attending treatment",
"if you have been told to go, you will be arrested and you will go to jail. This will happen for each",
and every violation.,
You will be frequently drug tested.,Your probation officer will advise you when to come in for
"testing. If you test positive, you will be arrested on the spot, held in custody, and we will have a",
"hearing a couple of days later. If you use drugs, you will go to jail. If you miss a drug test or a",
"scheduled appointment or don't comply with any other condition of probation, a police officer or",
"Sheriff's deputy will find you and arrest you. They will arrest you at work or home or wherever, and",
"you will go to jail. If you continue to violate the conditions of supervision, I can remove you from the",
"program and revoke your probation. If that happens, I may give you a prison sentence.",
"I understand that things happen in life. If your car breaks down on the way to the probation office,",
"push it to the side of the road, call your probation officer, tell him or her that you will be late, and get",
"on the bus. If you or your child is at the Emergency Room, call your probation officer to reschedule",
your appointment and be ready to bring proof of the medical treatment when you come for that,
appointment.,
"All of your actions in life have consequences, good or bad. If you confront your problems and learn",
"to change your thinking and your behavior, you will be able to follow the rules of probation and be",
"able to remain free in society. The more responsible you are, the more freedom you will have. The",
"less responsible you are, the less freedom you will have. If you violate the rules, there will be",
"consequences, and they will happen right away. It's all about your choices.",
Do you understand everything I just said? Do you have any questions for me?,
I wish you success on probation after today and hope I don't see you back in a courtroom anytime,
soon.,

,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Substance Abuse Treatment,
The swift-and-certain sanctions model has been shown to be extremely useful for,
distinguishing between offenders who are able to cease drug use through the,
"imposition of brief, but certain, jail stays and those who are unable to do so due to",
addiction issues.,An offender who continues to use drugs in spite of the knowledge
"that they will be drug-tested regularly, and who has been jailed multiple times for",
"continued use while in the Immediate Sanction Probation program, would be a likely",
candidate for substance abuse services. For participants in the Immediate Sanction,
Probation program who do not desist from drug or alcohol use in response to the,
"frequent random drug tests and repeated jail sanctions, the court may order a full",
substance abuse assessment and refer the offender to substance abuse treatment or a,
"drug court program, depending on the offender's suitability and the availability of",
"treatment resources. In addition, the judge can consider a participant's request for",
substance abuse treatment.,
"Used in this way, the swift-and-certain sanctions model relies on actual offender",
behavior rather than a substance abuse screening or offender self-report to signal a,
potential need for treatment services. Offenders who use drugs recreationally but,
"are able to stop on their own generally do so in the face of regular, random drug-",
testing and certainty of sanctions for use. Offenders who continue to test positive in,
spite of the consequences for this behavior are identified as those most likely to need,
services. This approach to identifying offenders with treatment needs has been,
"called ""behavioral triage"" (Hawken, 2010).",
Removal from Program,
The court may remove an offender from the Immediate Sanction Probation program,
at any time.,"If a participant is convicted of a new felony, the Sentencing Commission"
requires that he or she be removed from the program.,"If this occurs, the violation is"
handled through a full Show Cause hearing and sanctioning of the offender is left to,
the discretion of the court.,
Successful Completion,
"If an offender has gone 12 months since his or her last violation, the offender will be",
"considered as having ""successfully completed"" the Immediate Sanction Probation",
"program. The probationer may be returned to regular probation supervision, placed",
"on a less-restrictive level of supervision or, at the judge's discretion, released from",
supervision.,

provided by six court-appointed attorneys who have agreed to work with the,
Immediate Sanction Program.,Harrisonburg/Rockingham will also use court-
appointed attorneys. For hearings associated with the Immediate Sanction Probation,
"program, the court-appointed attorneys are paid at the same hourly rate as they are",
paid for traditional probation violation hearings ($90 per hour). This program may,
"result in additional hearings for some offenders, as they test the boundaries of the",
program and are brought back to court for each violation.,"During the pilot project,"
the Virginia Supreme Court is absorbing the cost of court-appointed attorneys for the,
"Immediate Sanction Probation program. As of September 27, 2013, the",
"expenditures for this purpose have totaled $4,320 ($1,492 in FY2013 and $2,828 in",

Court Processes,
The pilot sites have established an expedited court process for dealing with program,
candidates and violations.,Immediate Sanction Probation hearings are held on
multiple days of the week so that offenders will not spend long in jail before being,
considered for placement in the program or having a violation heard by the court.,
Hearings for violations occur swiftly (usually within three business days following,
arrest). This expedited process diverges significantly from the normal probation,
"violation process in Virginia, which can take weeks or even months in some",
jurisdictions.,
"In Henrico and Lynchburg (the two programs operational at the time of this report),",
"judges usually conduct Immediate Sanction Probation hearings on Monday,",
"Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 to 1:30 p.m.",This time slot is designated for both
"candidate review hearings, where the judge considers whether or not to place the",
"offender in the program, and program violations. If there are no candidates or",
"violations to be heard on a given day, stakeholders simply use the time for normal",
work-related activities.,Based on a sample of hearings conducted in Henrico and
"Lynchburg, the candidate review hearings last, on average, 9.5 minutes each, while",
violations have been handled in an average of 7.0 minutes.,This is comparable to
the length of hearings in Hawaii's HOPE program.,

,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
It has also been suggested that some offenders currently being supervised for a,
"violent offense may respond well to the structure provided by the program, but they",
are statutorily excluded at this time.,Research from the HOPE program in Hawaii
and a similar program in Washington indicates that offenders who are currently on,
supervision in the community for a violent offense may respond equally well to the,
close scrutiny and the swiftness and certainty of sanctions imposed in this type of,
program. Expanding Virginia's pilot program to include offenders currently on,
probation for a violent offense would require legislative action.,
Stakeholders in Lynchburg developed an innovative approach to expand the pool,
of eligible offenders.,The Probation & Parole District there covers several
"jurisdictions (the City of Lynchburg as well as Amherst, Campbell, and Nelson",
Counties).,Participants in the Lynchburg pilot program must have an obligation to
"Lynchburg Circuit Court. However, probation staff identified offenders believed to",
be good candidates for the program who lived just outside the Lynchburg City line.,
"At the suggestion of Lynchburg stakeholders, the Sentencing Commission approached",
"the Sheriffs in the neighboring Amherst and Campbell Counties, who agreed to assist",
with the pilot program by quickly executing Lynchburg's PB-15 arrest warrants in their,
"respective jurisdictions. As a result, the pool of potential program participants for",
Lynchburg's pilot has been expanded to include those living outside the Lynchburg,
City limits.,This is an excellent example of stakeholders innovating and collaborating
to improve the implementation of the program in their jurisdiction.,
Stakeholders have also provided feedback on the requirements for removing,
"offenders from the program and, as a result, the Sentencing Commission approved a",
modification.,Based on the Sentencing Commission's initial program design
"(approved September 2012), a participant convicted of any new offense would be",
removed from the program. After a participant who had been otherwise compliant,
"was cited for driving on a suspended license, some of the stakeholders from Henrico",
attended the Sentencing Commission's June 10 meeting to request that judges be,
given some discretion regarding removal of participants who have been convicted of,
a new offense. The concern was that an offender participating in the program might,
"be convicted of a minor misdemeanor offense, such as driving on a suspended",
license or being drunk in public.,"In most cases, however, an offender convicted of"
driving on a suspended license or certain other misdemeanor offenses is unlikely to,
serve significant jail time.,If the offender were removed from the Immediate
"Sanction Probation program, he or she would likely return to regular probation,",
where supervision would be less intensive than when the offender was participating,
in the program.,"Under these circumstances, continuing the offender in the Immediate"
Sanction Probation program following release from jail could better serve public,
safety.,The Sentencing Commission approved a change to provide judges with
discretion as to whether or not to remove offenders convicted of a new,
misdemeanor.,The Sentencing Commission continues to require that offenders
convicted of a new felony be removed from the program.,

,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Probation & Parole Districts piloting the Immediate Sanction Probation program have,
"also faced the challenge of ensuring that most, if not all, eligible candidates are",
referred to the court to be considered for placement in the program.,"The program,"
"as originally designed, relies heavily upon the probation officers in each District to",
identify offenders on their caseload who meet the eligibility criteria and have,
committed at least one recent technical violation.,In addition to identifying eligible
"candidates, probation officers are asked to prepare a Major Violation Report",
relatively quickly after candidate identification; the Major Violation Report is then,
submitted to the court as part of the referral process. Achieving a quick-turn around,
in the preparation of the Major Violation Report has proven to be challenging in,
"Districts that have experienced significant staff cuts in recent years, where probation",
"officers have large caseloads, or where officers prepare a high volume of Pre-",
Sentence Investigation reports. In order to encourage referrals and ensure that any,
"questions or concerns expressed by probation officers are addressed, DOC asked the",
Sentencing Commission to prepare and present materials to all of the probation,
officers in each of the pilot sites.,"To this end, the Chief Probation & Parole Officer in"
"District 13, which includes Lynchburg City, also established weekly staff meetings,",
where probation officers can discuss potential candidates for the program as well as,
the progress of participants. DOC asked Sentencing Commission staff to attend these,
"meetings (telephonically), which provides the Commission the opportunity to address",
questions or concerns from probation staff and to receive valuable feedback on the,
"program from probation officers. In fact, many of the suggestions for improvements",
to the program and ways to increase efficiency have stemmed from the weekly,
meetings with probation officers.,Due to the success of these weekly meetings in
"Lynchburg, DOC asked Henrico Probation & Parole to conduct similar meetings.",
"Depending on the topics discussed, these weekly meetings usually range from five to",
ten minutes in length. In addition to the District-wide efforts to encourage referrals,
"for the program, the Immediate Sanction Probation officers also play a significant",
role in encouraging fellow probation officers to refer potential candidates by,
"assisting in the identification of possible candidates, answering questions regarding",
"the program, and helping other officers complete the necessary paperwork for",
"referrals (i.e., the Major Violation Report).",
