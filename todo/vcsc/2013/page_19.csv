Judges have also typically agreed with guidelines recommendations for other types,
"of dispositions. In FY2013, 77% of offenders received a sentence resulting in",
confinement of six months or less when such a penalty was recommended.,In some
"cases, judges felt probation to be a more appropriate sanction than the",
"recommended jail term and, in other cases, offenders recommended for short-term",
incarceration received a sentence of more than six months.,"Finally, 71% of"
offenders whose guidelines recommendation called for no incarceration were given,
probation and no post-dispositional confinement.,"Some offenders with a ""no"
"incarceration"" recommendation received a short jail term, but rarely did these",
offenders receive an incarceration term of more than six months.,
"Since July 1, 1997, sentences to the state's former Boot Camp and the current",
Detention Center and Diversion Center programs have been defined as incarceration,
sanctions for the purposes of the sentencing guidelines. Although the state's Boot,
"Camp program was discontinued in 2002, the Detention and Diversion Center",
programs have continued as sentencing options for judges.,The Commission
recognized that these programs are more restrictive than probation supervision in the,
"community. In 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court concluded that participation in the",
Detention Center program is a form of incarceration (Charles v. Commonwealth).,
"Because the Diversion Center program also involves a period of confinement, the",
Commission defines both the Detention Center and the Diversion Center programs as,
incarceration terms under the sentencing guidelines.,"Since 1997, the Detention and"
Diversion Center programs have been counted as six months of confinement.,
"However, effective July 1, 2007, the Department of Corrections extended these",
programs by an additional four weeks.,"Therefore, beginning in FY2008, a sentence"
to either the Detention or Diversion Center program counted as seven months of,
confinement for sentencing guideline purposes.,
"Finally, youthful offenders sentenced under the provisions of § 19.2-311, and given",
"an indeterminate commitment to the Department of Corrections, are considered as",
having a four-year incarceration term for the purposes of sentencing guidelines.,
"Under § 19.2-311, a first-time offender who was less than 21 years of age at the",
time of the offense may be given an indeterminate commitment to the Department of,
Corrections with a maximum length-of-stay of four years. Offenders convicted of,
"capital murder, first-degree or second-degree murder, forcible rape (§ 18.2-61),",
"forcible sodomy (§ 18.2-67.1), object sexual penetration (§ 18.2-67.2) or",
"aggravated sexual battery of a victim less than age 13 (§ 18.2-67.3(A,1)) are not",
"eligible for the program. For sentencing guidelines purposes, offenders sentenced",
solely as youthful offenders under § 19.2-311 are considered as having a four-year,
sentence.,
