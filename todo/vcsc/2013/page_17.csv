,Guidelines Compliance
"by the guidelines. When risk assessment for nonviolent offenders is applicable, a",
judge may sentence a recommended offender to an alternative punishment program,
or to a term of incarceration within the traditional guidelines range and be,
considered in strict compliance.,A judicial sentence also would be considered in
general agreement with the guidelines recommendation if the sentence 1) meets,
"modest criteria for rounding, 2) involves time already served (in certain instances), or",
3) complies with statutorily-permitted diversion options in habitual offender traffic,
cases.,
Compliance by rounding provides for a modest rounding allowance in instances when,
the active sentence handed down by a judge or jury is very close to the range,
recommended by the guidelines.,"For example, a judge would be considered in"
compliance with the guidelines if he or she sentenced an offender to a two-year,
sentence based on a guidelines recommendation that goes up to 1 year 11 months.,
"In general, the Commission allows for rounding of a sentence that is within 5% of the",
guidelines recommendation.,
Time served compliance is intended to accommodate judicial discretion and the,
complexity of the criminal justice system at the local level.,A judge may sentence an
offender to the amount of pre-sentence incarceration time served in a local jail when,
the guidelines call for a short jail term.,Even though the judge does not sentence an
"offender to post-sentence incarceration time, the Commission typically considers this",
type of case to be in compliance.,"Conversely, a judge who sentences an offender to"
time served when the guidelines call for probation also is regarded as being in,
"compliance with the guidelines, because the offender was not ordered to serve any",
incarceration time after sentencing.,
Compliance through the use of diversion options in habitual offender traffic cases,
"resulted from amendments to § 46.2-357(B2 and B3) of the Code of Virginia,",
"effective July 1, 1997.",The amendment allows judges to suspend the mandatory
minimum 12-month incarceration term required in felony habitual offender traffic,
cases if they sentence the offender to a Detention Center or Diversion Center,
Incarceration Program.,For cases sentenced since the effective date of the
"legislation, the Commission considers either mode of sanctioning of these offenders to",
be in compliance with the sentencing guidelines.,
