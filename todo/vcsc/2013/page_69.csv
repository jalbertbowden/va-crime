,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Probation & Parole Districts piloting the Immediate Sanction Probation program have,
"also faced the challenge of ensuring that most, if not all, eligible candidates are",
referred to the court to be considered for placement in the program.,"The program,"
"as originally designed, relies heavily upon the probation officers in each District to",
identify offenders on their caseload who meet the eligibility criteria and have,
committed at least one recent technical violation.,In addition to identifying eligible
"candidates, probation officers are asked to prepare a Major Violation Report",
relatively quickly after candidate identification; the Major Violation Report is then,
submitted to the court as part of the referral process. Achieving a quick-turn around,
in the preparation of the Major Violation Report has proven to be challenging in,
"Districts that have experienced significant staff cuts in recent years, where probation",
"officers have large caseloads, or where officers prepare a high volume of Pre-",
Sentence Investigation reports. In order to encourage referrals and ensure that any,
"questions or concerns expressed by probation officers are addressed, DOC asked the",
Sentencing Commission to prepare and present materials to all of the probation,
officers in each of the pilot sites.,"To this end, the Chief Probation & Parole Officer in"
"District 13, which includes Lynchburg City, also established weekly staff meetings,",
where probation officers can discuss potential candidates for the program as well as,
the progress of participants. DOC asked Sentencing Commission staff to attend these,
"meetings (telephonically), which provides the Commission the opportunity to address",
questions or concerns from probation staff and to receive valuable feedback on the,
"program from probation officers. In fact, many of the suggestions for improvements",
to the program and ways to increase efficiency have stemmed from the weekly,
meetings with probation officers.,Due to the success of these weekly meetings in
"Lynchburg, DOC asked Henrico Probation & Parole to conduct similar meetings.",
"Depending on the topics discussed, these weekly meetings usually range from five to",
ten minutes in length. In addition to the District-wide efforts to encourage referrals,
"for the program, the Immediate Sanction Probation officers also play a significant",
role in encouraging fellow probation officers to refer potential candidates by,
"assisting in the identification of possible candidates, answering questions regarding",
"the program, and helping other officers complete the necessary paperwork for",
"referrals (i.e., the Major Violation Report).",
