,Immediate Sanction Probation Pilot Program
Substance Abuse Treatment,
The swift-and-certain sanctions model has been shown to be extremely useful for,
distinguishing between offenders who are able to cease drug use through the,
"imposition of brief, but certain, jail stays and those who are unable to do so due to",
addiction issues.,An offender who continues to use drugs in spite of the knowledge
"that they will be drug-tested regularly, and who has been jailed multiple times for",
"continued use while in the Immediate Sanction Probation program, would be a likely",
candidate for substance abuse services. For participants in the Immediate Sanction,
Probation program who do not desist from drug or alcohol use in response to the,
"frequent random drug tests and repeated jail sanctions, the court may order a full",
substance abuse assessment and refer the offender to substance abuse treatment or a,
"drug court program, depending on the offender's suitability and the availability of",
"treatment resources. In addition, the judge can consider a participant's request for",
substance abuse treatment.,
"Used in this way, the swift-and-certain sanctions model relies on actual offender",
behavior rather than a substance abuse screening or offender self-report to signal a,
potential need for treatment services. Offenders who use drugs recreationally but,
"are able to stop on their own generally do so in the face of regular, random drug-",
testing and certainty of sanctions for use. Offenders who continue to test positive in,
spite of the consequences for this behavior are identified as those most likely to need,
services. This approach to identifying offenders with treatment needs has been,
"called ""behavioral triage"" (Hawken, 2010).",
Removal from Program,
The court may remove an offender from the Immediate Sanction Probation program,
at any time.,"If a participant is convicted of a new felony, the Sentencing Commission"
requires that he or she be removed from the program.,"If this occurs, the violation is"
handled through a full Show Cause hearing and sanctioning of the offender is left to,
the discretion of the court.,
Successful Completion,
"If an offender has gone 12 months since his or her last violation, the offender will be",
"considered as having ""successfully completed"" the Immediate Sanction Probation",
"program. The probationer may be returned to regular probation supervision, placed",
"on a less-restrictive level of supervision or, at the judge's discretion, released from",
supervision.,
