RECOMMENDATION 1,,,
Revise the sentencing guidelines manual to instruct preparers to adjust the sentence,,,
"range recommended by the guidelines such that the low, midpoint, and high",,,
recommendations are at least equal to the sentence needed to run all mandatory minimum,,,
sentences consecutively.,,,
Issue,,,
"Currently, there are 109 felony and 46 non-felony mandatory minimum sentences defined",,,
in the Code of Virginia.,Many mandatory minimum penalty statutes specify that a,,
sentence under that particular provision must be run consecutively to the sentences,,,
"for all other charges; however, not all statutes clearly state this.",Because mandatory,,
"minimum statutes are not uniform in this regard, the instructions in the sentencing",,,
"guidelines manual state that, if a sentencing event contains multiple counts of an",,,
offense carrying a mandatory minimum or multiple offenses with mandatory minimum,,,
"penalties, the individual preparing the guidelines must adjust the sentence range",,,
recommended by the guidelines to reflect the possibility that the court may set the,,,
mandatory minimum sentences to run concurrently or consecutively to each other.,,,
The judge will interpret the language in each individual Code section and impose a,,,
sentence accordingly.,"Analysis reveals, however, that judges rarely set mandatory",,
minimum sentences to run concurrently. Because the guidelines are designed to reflect,,,
"historical sentencing practices, modifying the guidelines instruction to ensure that",,,
guidelines recommendations reflect consecutive mandatory minimum sentences will,,,
more closely match current judicial practice in these cases.,,,

RECOMMENDATION 2,,,
Amend the Miscellaneous sentencing guidelines to add violations of registration,,,
requirements associated with Virginia's Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors,,,
Registry (as defined in § 18.2-472.1).,,,
Issue,,,
"Currently, Virginia's sentencing guidelines do not cover violations of registration",,,
requirements associated with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry.,,,
Penalties for violations of registration procedures are defined in § 18.2-472.1 of the,,,
Code of Virginia.,There are more felony convictions for Registry violations than for,,
"any other felony not currently covered by the guidelines. After thorough analysis, the",,,
Commission has developed a proposal to incorporate Registry violations into the,,,
Miscellaneous guidelines.,,,
Discussion,,,
The General Assembly has revisited Chapter 9 of Title 9.1 (Sex Offender and Crimes,,,
Against Minors Registry Act) several times in recent years.,"In 2006, the General",,
Assembly added to the list of offenses requiring registration and increased the penalties,,,
for second or subsequent Registry violations.,"In addition, the Code was changed to",,
allow Juvenile and Domestic Relations court judges to require a juvenile who has been,,,
"adjudicated delinquent for a Registry offense to register. During the 2007 session, the",,,
information required of registrants was expanded and the list of crimes requiring,,,
registration was expanded and reorganized.,"In the 2008 session, the crimes requiring",,
registration were again restructured.,,,
Offenders who are required to register with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors,,,
Registry are assigned to one of two categories based on the offense for which they,,,
have been convicted. Offenders who have been convicted of a sexually violent offense,,,
as defined in § 9.1-902 comprise the majority of offenders who must register. Sexually,,,
"violent offenders are required to register more frequently and, per § 18.2-472.1, are",,,
subject to higher penalties for violating registration procedures. For a sexually violent,,,
"offender, it is a Class 6 felony to violate Registry requirements, while any second or",,,
subsequent violation is elevated to a Class 5 felony.,Other sex offenders make up a,,
"smaller portion of those on the Registry. For these offenders, it is a Class 1 misdemeanor",,,
"to violate Registry procedures, but a second or subsequent violation becomes a Class",,,
6 felony.,"Thus, there are three felonies defined in the Code for violating Registry",,
provisions.,,,
