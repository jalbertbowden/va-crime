,Recommendations of the Commission,,67
RECOMMENDATION 1,,,
Revise the sentencing guidelines manual to instruct preparers to adjust the sentence,,,
"range recommended by the guidelines such that the low, midpoint, and high",,,
recommendations are at least equal to the sentence needed to run all mandatory minimum,,,
sentences consecutively.,,,
Issue,,,
"Currently, there are 109 felony and 46 non-felony mandatory minimum sentences defined",,,
in the Code of Virginia.,Many mandatory minimum penalty statutes specify that a,,
sentence under that particular provision must be run consecutively to the sentences,,,
"for all other charges; however, not all statutes clearly state this.",Because mandatory,,
"minimum statutes are not uniform in this regard, the instructions in the sentencing",,,
"guidelines manual state that, if a sentencing event contains multiple counts of an",,,
offense carrying a mandatory minimum or multiple offenses with mandatory minimum,,,
"penalties, the individual preparing the guidelines must adjust the sentence range",,,
recommended by the guidelines to reflect the possibility that the court may set the,,,
mandatory minimum sentences to run concurrently or consecutively to each other.,,,
The judge will interpret the language in each individual Code section and impose a,,,
sentence accordingly.,"Analysis reveals, however, that judges rarely set mandatory",,
minimum sentences to run concurrently. Because the guidelines are designed to reflect,,,
"historical sentencing practices, modifying the guidelines instruction to ensure that",,,
guidelines recommendations reflect consecutive mandatory minimum sentences will,,,
more closely match current judicial practice in these cases.,,,
