,,Recommendations of the Commission
"During its analysis, the Commission",,Figure 76
discovered that sentencing practices,,
,Expected Guidelines Compliance for,
"for felony vandalism (§ 18.2-137(B,ii))","Felony Vandalism § 18.2-137 (B,ii)",
vary considerably. Based on recent,,
"sanctioning patterns, the proposed",,
guidelines would maximize the rate of,,Aggravation 25.5%
"judicial concurrence, although",,
compliance is expected to be lower,,
than the compliance rate for most,,
other offenses.,,
,,Mitigation 21.4%
"As proposed, compliance is expected",,
,,Compliance 53.1%
"to be approximately 53%, with a",,
roughly equal balance between,,
mitigation and aggravation,,
departures (Figure 76). This crime,,
will be the subject of ongoing study by,,
the Commission. Refining the,,
guidelines for this crime will likely be,,
"an iterative process, with",,
improvements made over several,,
years. Feedback from judges will be of,,
critical importance to this process.,,
The Commission's proposal is,,
designed to integrate current judicial,,
sanctioning practices into the,,
"guidelines; therefore, no impact on",,
correctional bed space is anticipated.,,
