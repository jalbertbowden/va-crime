"for felony vandalism (§ 18.2-137(B,ii))","Felony Vandalism § 18.2-137 (B,ii)",
vary considerably. Based on recent,,

than the compliance rate for most,,

"As proposed, compliance is expected",,
,,Compliance 53.1%
"to be approximately 53%, with a",,

will be the subject of ongoing study by,,
the Commission. Refining the,,
guidelines for this crime will likely be,,
"an iterative process, with",,
improvements made over several,,
years. Feedback from judges will be of,,
critical importance to this process.,,
