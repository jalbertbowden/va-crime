Goals of Sentencing Reform,"An essential goal of the reform,"
,"therefore, was to reduce drastically"
The cornerstone of reform in Virginia,the gap between the sentence
was the abolition of discretionary,pronounced in the courtroom and the
parole release and the adoption of,time actually served by a convicted
truth-in-sentencing. Under parole,felon in prison. Under Virginia’s truth-
"eligibility laws, inmates served a","in-sentencing system, parole was"
fraction of the sentence handed down,eliminated for any felony committed
by a judge or a jury before becoming,"on or after January 1, 1995, and the"
eligible for parole release. A first-time,system by which prison inmates earn
"inmate, for example, became eligible",sentence credits was revamped. In
for parole after serving one-fourth of,contrast to the 30 days an inmate
"his sentence. In addition, inmates",could receive for every 30 days served
could earn as much as 30 days in,"under the parole system, an offender"
sentence credits for every 30 days they,committed to the state penitentiary
served. Half of this sentence credit,under truth-in-sentencing provisions
could be applied toward the offender’s,may not earn more than 4.5 days for
"parole eligibility date, further reducing",every 30 days served (or 15%) off his
the portion of the sentence that needed,"incarceration sentence. Prior to 1995,"
to be served before a prisoner could be,felons sentenced to jail served their
granted parole and released. As a,time under different provisions than
"result, inmates often served as little",felons in state prisons. Under truth-
as one-fifth of the sentence ordered by,"in-sentencing, all felons must serve at"
the court.,least 85% of the incarceration
,sentence regardless of whether they
,serve that time in a local jail or in a
,state institution.
