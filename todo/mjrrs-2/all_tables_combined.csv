By the time they graduate from,
"high school, about 46 percent of",
teens will have tried marijuana.1,
Although current use among U.S.,
teens dropped dramatically in,
the past decade (to a prevalence,
"of about 15 percent in 2011), this",Marijuana
decline has stalled during the,
past several years.2 These data,
are from the Monitoring the,

tracking drug use among teens,
"since 1975. Still, the World Health",
Organization ranks the United,
States first among 17 European,
and North American countries,
for prevalence of marijuana use.,
And more users start every day.,
"In 2010, an estimated 2.4 million",
Americans used marijuana for the,
first time; greater than one-half,
were under age 18.1,
