Authority
"2013 Virginia Acts of Assembly, Chapter 806, Item 69:"
L. The Compensation Board shall work with local and regional jails to determine the number of
"local-responsible offenders hospitalized off-site, the costs for such hospitalization, and the numbers"
"of such hospitalized local-responsible offenders who are either 65 years of age or older, blind,"
"disabled, or pregnant in order to determine the population of local-responsible offenders who may"
be eligible for enrollment in Medicaid. The Departments of Medical Assistance Services and Social
Services shall provide any assistance necessary to the Compensation Board in determining the
eligibility of those local-responsible offenders for Medicaid enrollment and the process that would
be necessary for localities who choose to enroll eligible local-responsible offenders in Medicaid. The
"Compensation Board, with any necessary assistance from the Departments of Medical Assistance"
"Services and Social Services, shall provide a report on the number of local-responsible offenders who"
could be enrolled in Medicaid to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance
"Committees by November 1, 2013."
Introduction
"Item 69 L of the 2013 Appropriation Act directed the Compensation Board (hereafter, the"
Board) to work with local and regional jails to determine the number and cost of local-
responsible offenders hospitalized off-site who may be eligible for enrollment in Medicaid. It
further directed the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) and the Department of
Social Services (DSS) to provide any assistance necessary to the Board in determining the
eligibility of those offenders through the potential establishment of procedures to enroll
eligible offenders in Medicaid. The Board was directed to provide a report on the number of
local-responsible offenders who could be enrolled in Medicaid to the General Assembly by
"November 1, 2013. This document is intended to satisfy this reporting requirement."

Background
Under current Medicaid policy articulated by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
"Services (CMS), inmates of public institutions are categorically ineligible for coverage under"
"Medicaid. However, CMS clarified this policy indicating that they are no longer “inmates of"
"public institutions” when they are “inpatients of medical facilities”, and therefore, federal"
Medicaid funding is available for the covered services provided while they are an inpatient of
that facility.
"In Virginia, the normal Medicaid match rate is 50 percent, meaning for every dollar of Medicaid"
"cost, one-half is borne by the federal government and one-half is borne by the Commonwealth."
"However, the Commonwealth does not provide General Funds to cover the costs of healthcare"
"needs of incarcerated, local-responsible offenders. Thus, the costs of needed healthcare to"
these inmates in local and regional jails are borne by the localities themselves. To the extent
some local-responsible inmates can access Medicaid funding to cover their inpatient
"hospitalization, some of the cost of inpatient care to the localities would be eliminated through"
"Medicaid funding. In other words, while coverage under Medicaid for state-responsible"
offenders has the potential to be financially beneficial to the Commonwealth through the
"substitution of federal funds in place of State funds, this approach for local-responsible"
"offenders would result in an added cost to the Commonwealth, with a reduction in local costs."
"It is important to note, as indicated above, that these costs can only be offset for inmates who"
are determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the point of their inpatient hospitalization.
"Existing eligibility rules apply; the only special treatment, so-to-speak, is the waiving of the"
"inmate exclusion based on the CMS policy clarification. In other words, if the individual would"
"not be eligible for coverage according to existing coverage rules were they not incarcerated,"
they would not be eligible when they are an inmate during an inpatient hospitalization.
This is particularly important to understand in the context of inmates because existing coverage
for non-disabled adults is only available for adults living with children (caretaker adults /
"parents), those above age 65, or for pregnant women. While some inmates may qualify under"
these non-disabled adult categories and others may have already been determined to be
"disabled (and meet the other criteria for that coverage group), it is not expected that a"
"significant percentage of the inmate population, particularly the local-responsible offender"
"population, will qualify for Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital services under the current"
rules.
To the extent the Commonwealth decides to expand Medicaid coverage under the Patient
"Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and"
"Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L 111-152), such an expansion would increase"
"the income eligibility of the caretaker adults / parents, but more significant for the inmate"
"population, provide coverage for childless adults up to 133 percent of the federal poverty limit."
"Under that scenario, it is likely that a significant number of the local-responsible inmate"
population would be eligible for Medicaid coverage of their inpatient hospitalizations.

Offenders in Local and Regional Jails
Virginia’s 65 local and regional jails house both local-responsible and state-responsible inmates.
A local-responsible inmate is defined as any person arrested on a state warrant and
"incarcerated in a local correctional facility awaiting trial, or already sentenced but awaiting trial"
on a subsequent offense; any person convicted of a misdemeanor offense and sentenced to a
term in a local correctional facility; or any person convicted of a felony offense and given an
"effective sentence of twelve months or less, or less than one year. A state-responsible inmate"
is defined as any person convicted of one or more felony offenses and the sum of consecutive
"effective sentences for felonies, committed on or after January 1, 1995, is more than 12"
"months, or one year or more, or the sum of consecutive effective sentences for felonies,"
"committed before January 1, 1995, is more than two years."
State-responsible inmates are housed in local and regional jail facilities until such time as they
"are due for transfer to a facility of the Department of Corrections. Generally speaking, a state-"
responsible inmate remains housed in a jail for at least 90 days post-sentencing with all charges
adjudicated (the DOC is to bring in a state responsible inmate from the jail within 60 days after
"receiving the complete and final court order, which it should receive from the court within 30"
"days after final sentencing), however, many state-responsible inmates remain in jail longer due"
"to a shortage of available space within DOC facilities. In FY12/FY13, state-responsible inmates"
transferred from jail to a DOC facility had remained in jail for an average of 239 days post-
sentencing before being transferred. State-responsible inmates that remained in the jail for the
duration of their incarceration without ever transferring to a DOC facility had remained in jail
for an average of 340 days post-sentencing before their release. During the time that a state-
"responsible inmate is housed in a local or regional jail, localities remain primarily responsible"
for the cost of incurred medical expenses. Information in this report noted previously regarding
eligibility determination and claims processing for state-responsible offenders for coverage
under Medicaid does not apply to the state-responsible offenders housed in Virginia’s local and
regional jails.
While the Appropriation Act directed the Board to report on numbers and costs for local-
"responsible offenders, this report does also include numbers and costs for state-responsible"
offenders who are housed in local and regional jail facilities and not in a DOC facility. Although
approximately 30% of the average daily population (ADP) of inmates incarcerated in local and
"regional jail facilities are state-responsible (8,266 SR ADP of 27,533 total ADP in FY12 & FY13),"
only 14% of reported in-patient hospitalizations involved state-responsible offenders (113
average SR hospital commitments v. 795 average total hospital commitments in FY12 & FY13).
While there are some mechanisms in place for the DOC and the Board to assist with medical
"costs incurred by localities for state-responsible offenders housed in local and regional jails, the"
"majority of medical costs remain the responsibility of the locality, and those costs are included"
in this report.

"$580,802. Using these figures to estimate additional inmates and costs that may be incurred in"
"the 9 non-Anthem jails, the Board projects a potential additional 6 inmates meeting Medicaid"
"eligibility criteria at an additional cost of $95,020. Therefore, the total estimated average cost"
"per year in FY12 and FY13 is $675,822 for an estimated 46 inmates meeting the current"
"Medicaid eligibility criteria of over aged 65, pregnant, or disabled. While this cost would"
"presently be the responsibility of the locality, or locality participants in the case of a regional"
"jail, if these inmates were to be determined eligible and claims processed for Medicaid funding,"
"one-half of this amount ($337,911) would represent the General Fund cost to the"
Commonwealth (with the remainder funded by federal Medicaid funds). Note that these costs
represent negotiated rates for services with a private carrier and coverage under Medicaid
"could yield lower rates, however, the difference between the average costs per hospitalization"
from Anthem data and average rates for state-responsible inmates in DOC facilities under
Medicaid does not appear to be significant.
"As noted previously in the background information regarding Medicaid coverage and inmates,"
"under a potential expansion of Medicaid coverage, it is likely that a significant number of the"
local and regional jail inmate population would be eligible for Medicaid coverage of their in-
patient hospitalizations. Where in-patient hospitalization costs incurred were reported for
"inmates in 56 jails using Anthem services, projecting total costs for inmates in all 65 local and"
regional jails could indicate a potential cost of $5.97 million for approximately 399 inmates.
"However, given the more “short-term” nature of the local-responsible inmate population in"
"jails, where a large portion of inmates may be awaiting trial and may either maintain alternate"
"health care coverage, or may maintain an income level that could preclude eligibility for"
"Medicaid coverage, further evaluation would be required to determine the full potential impact"
of expansion on this population.
Summary statistics and details of numbers and costs of in-patient hospitalizations in FY12 and
FY13 can be found in the appendix to this report.

Conclusion
The Compensation Board and the Departments of Medical Assistance Services and Social
Services have collaborated to identify the population of offenders in local and regional jails
"potentially eligible for Medicaid coverage of their inpatient hospitalizations, as directed under"
"the 2013 Appropriation Act. Even more than the program for state-responsible offenders,"
applying the coverage policy to offenders at local and regional jails could present significant
challenges due to the decentralized nature of these facilities in relation to the multitude of local
social services agencies with which they would need to work.
While inmate and cost figures have been provided based upon actual in-patient hospitalizations
"across most local and regional jails, these estimates may be tenuous as they relate to the"
"number of disabled inmates, given the current limited expertise within jails to identify whether"
inmates that previously incurred a hospital commitment met the criteria for a DSS disability
"designation or are otherwise eligible for coverage under Medicaid. However, despite the lack"
"of expertise in identifying whether a disability designation is appropriate, the low numbers of"
inmates with in-patient hospitalizations meeting current Medicaid eligibility criteria is not
"unexpected, as alternatives to incarceration are likely employed for inmates awaiting trial that"
"may be disabled, pregnant or over age 65, thus reducing the frequency of this type of offender"
from the population in local and regional jails.
"Finally, the actual costs incurred (and projected for the small portion without data), while small"
given the number of individuals that are committed and released from local and regional jail
"facilities each year, are subject to change and would require additional analysis in the event of"
expansion of Medicaid coverage in Virginia.
