"$580,802. Using these figures to estimate additional inmates and costs that may be incurred in"
"the 9 non-Anthem jails, the Board projects a potential additional 6 inmates meeting Medicaid"
"eligibility criteria at an additional cost of $95,020. Therefore, the total estimated average cost"
"per year in FY12 and FY13 is $675,822 for an estimated 46 inmates meeting the current"
"Medicaid eligibility criteria of over aged 65, pregnant, or disabled. While this cost would"
"presently be the responsibility of the locality, or locality participants in the case of a regional"
"jail, if these inmates were to be determined eligible and claims processed for Medicaid funding,"
"one-half of this amount ($337,911) would represent the General Fund cost to the"
Commonwealth (with the remainder funded by federal Medicaid funds). Note that these costs
represent negotiated rates for services with a private carrier and coverage under Medicaid
"could yield lower rates, however, the difference between the average costs per hospitalization"
from Anthem data and average rates for state-responsible inmates in DOC facilities under
Medicaid does not appear to be significant.
"As noted previously in the background information regarding Medicaid coverage and inmates,"
"under a potential expansion of Medicaid coverage, it is likely that a significant number of the"
local and regional jail inmate population would be eligible for Medicaid coverage of their in-
patient hospitalizations. Where in-patient hospitalization costs incurred were reported for
"inmates in 56 jails using Anthem services, projecting total costs for inmates in all 65 local and"
regional jails could indicate a potential cost of $5.97 million for approximately 399 inmates.
"However, given the more “short-term” nature of the local-responsible inmate population in"
"jails, where a large portion of inmates may be awaiting trial and may either maintain alternate"
"health care coverage, or may maintain an income level that could preclude eligibility for"
"Medicaid coverage, further evaluation would be required to determine the full potential impact"
of expansion on this population.
Summary statistics and details of numbers and costs of in-patient hospitalizations in FY12 and
FY13 can be found in the appendix to this report.
