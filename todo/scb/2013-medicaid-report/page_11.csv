Conclusion
The Compensation Board and the Departments of Medical Assistance Services and Social
Services have collaborated to identify the population of offenders in local and regional jails
"potentially eligible for Medicaid coverage of their inpatient hospitalizations, as directed under"
"the 2013 Appropriation Act. Even more than the program for state-responsible offenders,"
applying the coverage policy to offenders at local and regional jails could present significant
challenges due to the decentralized nature of these facilities in relation to the multitude of local
social services agencies with which they would need to work.
While inmate and cost figures have been provided based upon actual in-patient hospitalizations
"across most local and regional jails, these estimates may be tenuous as they relate to the"
"number of disabled inmates, given the current limited expertise within jails to identify whether"
inmates that previously incurred a hospital commitment met the criteria for a DSS disability
"designation or are otherwise eligible for coverage under Medicaid. However, despite the lack"
"of expertise in identifying whether a disability designation is appropriate, the low numbers of"
inmates with in-patient hospitalizations meeting current Medicaid eligibility criteria is not
"unexpected, as alternatives to incarceration are likely employed for inmates awaiting trial that"
"may be disabled, pregnant or over age 65, thus reducing the frequency of this type of offender"
from the population in local and regional jails.
"Finally, the actual costs incurred (and projected for the small portion without data), while small"
given the number of individuals that are committed and released from local and regional jail
"facilities each year, are subject to change and would require additional analysis in the event of"
expansion of Medicaid coverage in Virginia.
