Background
Under current Medicaid policy articulated by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
"Services (CMS), inmates of public institutions are categorically ineligible for coverage under"
"Medicaid. However, CMS clarified this policy indicating that they are no longer “inmates of"
"public institutions” when they are “inpatients of medical facilities”, and therefore, federal"
Medicaid funding is available for the covered services provided while they are an inpatient of
that facility.
"In Virginia, the normal Medicaid match rate is 50 percent, meaning for every dollar of Medicaid"
"cost, one-half is borne by the federal government and one-half is borne by the Commonwealth."
"However, the Commonwealth does not provide General Funds to cover the costs of healthcare"
"needs of incarcerated, local-responsible offenders. Thus, the costs of needed healthcare to"
these inmates in local and regional jails are borne by the localities themselves. To the extent
some local-responsible inmates can access Medicaid funding to cover their inpatient
"hospitalization, some of the cost of inpatient care to the localities would be eliminated through"
"Medicaid funding. In other words, while coverage under Medicaid for state-responsible"
offenders has the potential to be financially beneficial to the Commonwealth through the
"substitution of federal funds in place of State funds, this approach for local-responsible"
"offenders would result in an added cost to the Commonwealth, with a reduction in local costs."
"It is important to note, as indicated above, that these costs can only be offset for inmates who"
are determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the point of their inpatient hospitalization.
"Existing eligibility rules apply; the only special treatment, so-to-speak, is the waiving of the"
"inmate exclusion based on the CMS policy clarification. In other words, if the individual would"
"not be eligible for coverage according to existing coverage rules were they not incarcerated,"
they would not be eligible when they are an inmate during an inpatient hospitalization.
This is particularly important to understand in the context of inmates because existing coverage
for non-disabled adults is only available for adults living with children (caretaker adults /
"parents), those above age 65, or for pregnant women. While some inmates may qualify under"
these non-disabled adult categories and others may have already been determined to be
"disabled (and meet the other criteria for that coverage group), it is not expected that a"
"significant percentage of the inmate population, particularly the local-responsible offender"
"population, will qualify for Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital services under the current"
rules.
To the extent the Commonwealth decides to expand Medicaid coverage under the Patient
"Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and"
"Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L 111-152), such an expansion would increase"
"the income eligibility of the caretaker adults / parents, but more significant for the inmate"
"population, provide coverage for childless adults up to 133 percent of the federal poverty limit."
"Under that scenario, it is likely that a significant number of the local-responsible inmate"
population would be eligible for Medicaid coverage of their inpatient hospitalizations.
