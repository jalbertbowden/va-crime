Offenders in Local and Regional Jails
Virginia’s 65 local and regional jails house both local-responsible and state-responsible inmates.
A local-responsible inmate is defined as any person arrested on a state warrant and
"incarcerated in a local correctional facility awaiting trial, or already sentenced but awaiting trial"
on a subsequent offense; any person convicted of a misdemeanor offense and sentenced to a
term in a local correctional facility; or any person convicted of a felony offense and given an
"effective sentence of twelve months or less, or less than one year. A state-responsible inmate"
is defined as any person convicted of one or more felony offenses and the sum of consecutive
"effective sentences for felonies, committed on or after January 1, 1995, is more than 12"
"months, or one year or more, or the sum of consecutive effective sentences for felonies,"
"committed before January 1, 1995, is more than two years."
State-responsible inmates are housed in local and regional jail facilities until such time as they
"are due for transfer to a facility of the Department of Corrections. Generally speaking, a state-"
responsible inmate remains housed in a jail for at least 90 days post-sentencing with all charges
adjudicated (the DOC is to bring in a state responsible inmate from the jail within 60 days after
"receiving the complete and final court order, which it should receive from the court within 30"
"days after final sentencing), however, many state-responsible inmates remain in jail longer due"
"to a shortage of available space within DOC facilities. In FY12/FY13, state-responsible inmates"
transferred from jail to a DOC facility had remained in jail for an average of 239 days post-
sentencing before being transferred. State-responsible inmates that remained in the jail for the
duration of their incarceration without ever transferring to a DOC facility had remained in jail
for an average of 340 days post-sentencing before their release. During the time that a state-
"responsible inmate is housed in a local or regional jail, localities remain primarily responsible"
for the cost of incurred medical expenses. Information in this report noted previously regarding
eligibility determination and claims processing for state-responsible offenders for coverage
under Medicaid does not apply to the state-responsible offenders housed in Virginia’s local and
regional jails.
While the Appropriation Act directed the Board to report on numbers and costs for local-
"responsible offenders, this report does also include numbers and costs for state-responsible"
offenders who are housed in local and regional jail facilities and not in a DOC facility. Although
approximately 30% of the average daily population (ADP) of inmates incarcerated in local and
"regional jail facilities are state-responsible (8,266 SR ADP of 27,533 total ADP in FY12 & FY13),"
only 14% of reported in-patient hospitalizations involved state-responsible offenders (113
average SR hospital commitments v. 795 average total hospital commitments in FY12 & FY13).
While there are some mechanisms in place for the DOC and the Board to assist with medical
"costs incurred by localities for state-responsible offenders housed in local and regional jails, the"
"majority of medical costs remain the responsibility of the locality, and those costs are included"
in this report.
