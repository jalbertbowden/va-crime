Subject: Re: Exposure draft of Federal Overhead Recovery Report
Thank you for providing the Exposure Draft and for the opportunity to respond.
"Option #2 is the option that is most favorable to my local jurisdictions and, therefore, it is the option that I"
"vigorously support. Option #2 has the advantages of simplicity, consistency and fairness. It would be a"
"great advantage to the regional and local jails, as well as to the State, to be able to plan their finances on"
"the basis of a known, fixed amount of $14 per day; rather than on the current uncertain amounts that"
"change each year based on complex, unpredictable computations that result annually in different rates for"
"each individual jail. Also, it appeared to me that there was a fairly strong consensus of the task force"
members in favor of Option #2.
Option #4 is patently unfair to regional jails. It is based on an accounting nuance of the Jail Cost Report's
accounting methodology that affects regional jails differently than county and city jails. This option should
be eliminated from consideration.
Options #1 and #3 should be rejected as less favorable than Option #2.
"With regard to the exemptions, I do not object to them because they were previously provided by State"
legislation. My feeing is that this is mainly an issue between the State and the affected jurisdictions.
"However, if there is some revenue target that is being sought by the State, I would certainly be in favor of"
a recovery methodology that would not negatively impact my local jurisdictions.
"In summary, I strongly support Option #2, either with exemptions or without exemptions."
