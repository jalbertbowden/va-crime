Background
"During the 1999 General Assembly session, concern was raised regarding the"
"housing of federal and out of state inmates in local and regional jails. Particularly,"
the use of Commonwealth funding through correctional staff salaries and fringe
"benefits as well as capital construction funds to support the housing of inmates,"
which generate per diem income for the jail without any of those funds being
"returned to the Commonwealth, was seen as problematic."
"As a result, the 2000 Appropriation Act included the following language:"
J. 1 The Compensation Board shall recover and deposit into the general fund 50
percent of the federal share of state-funded personnel costs based on the
percentage of contract federal prisoners to total prisoners held in a local or regional
jail.
The ability to exempt inmate capacity from this recovery process was also included:
The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any local or regional jail where the
cumulative federal share of the capital cost exceeds the Commonwealth’s
cumulative capital contribution.
With a solid history of accurate revenue and expenditures for Virginia’s local and
"regional jails, the Compensation Board’s annual Jail Cost Report was utilized"
beginning in 2002 following a change in the methodology for calculating the
overhead recovery as noted in the Appropriation Act from that session:
H. 1 The Compensation Board shall recover the state-funded personnel costs
"associated with housing federal inmates, District of Columbia inmates or contract"
"inmates from other states. The Compensation Board shall determine, by individual"
"jail, the amount to be recovered by the Commonwealth by multiplying the jail’s"
current inmate days for this population by the proportion of the jail’s per inmate day
"salary funds provided by the Commonwealth, as identified in the most recent Jail"
Cost Report prepared by the Compensation Board.
This methodology is currently in place and for fiscal year 2003 it captured
"$7,236,843 for the Commonwealth’s general fund."
