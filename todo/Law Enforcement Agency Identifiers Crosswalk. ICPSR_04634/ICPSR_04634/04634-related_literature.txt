An ancillary objective of the project was to illustrate the utility of the
resulting data archive. This was done by addressing three research issues:
a uniform set of analyses across States, counties, and cities; an
assessment of the conditional effects of economic conditions on recent
crime trends; and an expanded analysis of the effects of key criminal
justice features on recent crime trends that have not been widely
considered in prior research. These criminal justice features include the
nature of policing and age-specific and crime-specific imprisonment rates.
The specific samples, time frames, and measures used varied across the
three issues addressed; however, the general analytical strategy in
addressing these issues is to construct, when possible, a panel database
with requisite measures focused on the following time points: 1980, 1985,
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. This was done using the Crime Trends Data
Archive (CTDA) produced by the project. This approach benefits from the
strength of a pooled cross-sectional design, while avoiding the data
imputation that is required to support panel analyses of annual time
periods for sub-national geographic units. The three sets of empirical
analyses conducted in this project include models of overall homicide, non-
lethal violence (robbery and aggravated assault), and non-violent property
crime (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and larceny). The project estimated a
series of two-way fixed-effects panel models of crime rates that include
fixed effects that control for stable, but unmeasured, city attributes and
temporal shocks that are shared across cities. This report also identifies
factors that influence crime rates, including criminal justice policies and
practices.
