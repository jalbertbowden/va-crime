term effects of,
methamphetamine,
abuse?,
See page 4.,
from the director:,Research Report Series
The abuse of methamphetamine—a potent,
and highly addictive stimulant—remains,
an extremely serious problem in the,
United States. According to data from the,
2012 National Survey on Drug Use and,
"Health (NSDUH), over 12 million people",
(4.7 percent of the population) have tried,
methamphetamine at least once. NSDUH,
also reports that approximately 1.2 million,
people used methamphetamine in the year,
leading up to the survey.,
The consequences of methamphetamine,
abuse are terrible for the individual––,
"psychologically, medically, and socially.",
"Abusing the drug can cause memory loss,",
"aggression, psychotic behavior, damage to",

severe dental problems. Methamphetamine,
abuse has also been shown to contribute,
to increased transmission of infectious,
"diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS.",
Beyond its devastating effects on individual,
