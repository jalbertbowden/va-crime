The Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office continues to participate and remain active in the community. Some examples would include the School Resource Officer Program, regular scheduled Community Presentations (League of Aging) and the Child Identification Program (Masonic Lodge). Crime Prevention is and will continue to be an important tool to address the prevention of criminal activity, enforce county and state codes and provide county citizens with an efficient and reliable resource in times of need.

Community Concerns and Complaints
The Botetourt County Emergency Communications Center is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week and accepts emergency and non-emergency calls. Remember! Dial 911 for an Emergency. For non-emergencies dial (540) 473-8230. Requests by citizens for Law Enforcement assistance are addressed according to the priority of the request. Sheriff Sprinkle has an ongoing and receptive “open door” policy that welcomes comments, concerns and questions from all citizens.

Issues Affecting Law Enforcement Activities
Current budget reductions (federal, state & local) coupled with the increase of expenditures (Vehicles, Fuel, Equipment, etc.) have and continue to affect local law enforcement activities. The Botetourt County Sheriff’s Office and Jail continue to operate in the Botetourt/Craig Public Safety Building, located at 205 N. Roanoke Street in Fincastle, Virginia 24090.
